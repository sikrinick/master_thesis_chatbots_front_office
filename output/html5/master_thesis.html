</h3>
<!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >In 2007 PSD had shown an interest of financial regulators in banking competitiveness by
digital instruments. Later, PSD2 triggered a new wave of banking digitalization,
openness, big data usage and third-party integrations. This thesis seeks to analyze the
ways of development of commercial banks Front Offices using ML &#x0026; AI technologies.
The research focuses on the importance of openness brought by PSD2 and Open
Banking initiative. Study investigates ways of application of ML &#x0026; AI technologies on
various layers of a bank and targets the importance of usage of available customer
data in order to achieve market efficiency. The thesis proposes possible Chat-Bot
solutions as a front-office, as a middle-office kit for front-end employees, as a product,
which uses Banking-as-a-Platform and as a customer service solution for existing
Banking-as-a-Service.

<a

<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >Nowadays, it is practically impossible to imagine life without online banking. Online banking is
extremelly comfortable for the clients because of its simplicity and speed of provided services. It
is pretty obvious, that banks are striving to develop this field. The main priority
is the comfort of a client, leading to development of Big Data as a main branch of
improvements. Based on Gartner, around 34% of banks were investing into Big Data
technologies.
</p><!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >     Banks are storing everything — profiles, transactions and customer history, internal
information. Repositories are literally inflated to petabytes of data. Artificial Intelligence in a
connection with Machine Learning allows software to study client behaviour and make decisions
autonomously.
</p><!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >     However, in any case, at least for now, there should be a manager, who would follow and
approve decisions that were made programmatically. Both Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning have been being used for a long time, but it is reaching its peak with Big Data, with
which it allows processing huge amounts of information quickly and efficiently. Consequently, it
is critically important for the banking industry to rely on and collect more information about
each client.
</p><!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >     The reason for the development of the financial sector at the moment is its use of Big
Data, which allows you to provide a fully customized service for each client. Information is 21st
century gold and these technologies use it to provide services that a client already
requires. One of the priorities for the financial sector now is to collect information
about each client to improve his experience. The most commonplace example will be
the operations at the ATM, which the client constantly performs. The goal of the
bank is to process information received about all operations and, on the next visit,
immediately carry out the usual operation with one button, without searching and
numbers.
</p><!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >     That is why the International Data Corporation (IDC) forecasts Big Data Analytics profit
growth to $274 billion dollars by 2022 (against $149 billion in 2017).  The largest
amount of investment goes to Big Data startups that are connected to the cloud
and use a subscription system. Also, many startups combine Big Data Analytics
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to enhance the capabilities of this
area.
</p><!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >     Information obtained using Big Data can be used to: Creation and functioning of the
engine, which determines the optimal place for opening physical banks. The financial institution
collects information about the most visited areas of the city, the time of visiting these areas,
stores in which their customers go, where the largest and least number of customers. Using this
data and analytics, you can determine the most profitable and visited place to open a bank or
any other financial institution.
</p><!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >     Risk management and fraud prevention, these are the 2 hottest topics for banks
at the moment and that’s why these projects were addressed first with innovative
analytics technologies, Machine Learning and Big Data. Banks calculate all possible
options for risks and fraudsters and discard them at the first suspicion. Extension
of customer base interest in the bank’s services: In addition to access to data on
economic activity, the bank may also receive extraneous data, such as data from social
networks or online behavior, to add this information to the ecosystem that surrounds the
customer.
</p><!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >     By analyzing this information, which is located in Big Data, the bank discovers many new
opportunities. For example, if a user discusses the possibility of buying a new car in the
comments, then the bank can generate loan offers of the very machine that the client is
dreaming of and send these offers instantly to him by e-mail.
</p><!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >     Clients demand the most comfortable channels of communication that they use every day,
such as social media, email, or instant messengers. The bank should determine the priority
channel of communications for certain group of clients and send all notifications, new offers and
contact through them. This will allow the client to feel that the bank is much closer to him and
more service-friendly. At the same time it will allow the bank to spend less on other
channels of communication. Moreover, it allows determining and predict when the
client plans to change the financial institution by analyzing internal and external
data about the client. For example, if a client has not visited physical branches of a
bank for a long time, does not visit a website and is subscribed to updates of other
banks in social services, networks, then the chance that he leaves the bank can be
predetermined.
</p><!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >     At such moment, it is important for the bank to promote to the client by recommending
products or offers that the client is longing for at the moment. One of the main problems of
using Big Data, oddly enough, is the issue of ethical use of results, customers should feel a sense
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
of security of their private life using the services of a bank.
</p><!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >     The best option for using Big Data technology will be its use in the internal
processes of the institution, without showing the most detailed information to the
client.
</p><!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >     This is achieved with a few steps, the first of which identifies the needs of certain
customers, and the next step masks these needs for mass mailing or possible communication
scenarios, adjusting them to those that are already in the Big Data database.
</p><!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >     This thesis analyzes current state of banking in respect to various Open Banking initatives
and PSD2. Next, it analyzes Artificial Intelligence application in Commercial Banking and its
history. Considering the Conversational Banking trend and dialog-based communication need,
author investigates existing forms of automatic conversational banking, voice and
textual chat-bots. Consequently, author proposes a front-office development strategy
based on mentioned trends in a form of a chat-bot based on Artificial Intelligence,
Machine Learning and Natural Language Programming. Based on available statistics,
author proposes ways of achieving strategy targets in accordance with existing market
conditions.
</p><!--l. 77--><p class="indent" >     The aim of the thesis is to research current state of industry, regulations and technology in
order to examine requirements for a Chat-bot solution with Artificial Intelligence in a
Commercial Banking Front Office and usefulness of such solution in a current market
state.
</p><!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >     The main hypothesis is: Commercial Banking clients are ready for Automated Front
Offices in a form of Chat-bot with Artificial Intelligence and will positevely react to its injection
into banking infrastracture.

<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >     In modern banking systems there are two types of banking institutions — central banks
and commercial banks. The activity of Central Bank of any country aims to solve next three
tasks: ensuring stability and purchasing power of the national currency, stability and liquidity of
the banking system, efficiency and reliability of the payment system. At the same time, Central
Bank operate as an intermediary between the state and commercial banks, and, respectively,
rest of the economy through commercial banks. In modern conditions, the Central Bank,
usually, performs following functions:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">

      <li class="itemize">
      <!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >Main state settlement centre </p></li></ul>
<!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >     Obviously, this list of functions can be changed, by adding or removing certain
functions for different countries, as every country has its own view on banking system,
based on cultural, historical and religious conditions, but as we focus on European
and/or United States banking systems, we may stick to this list. Commercial bank,
in its turn, is a bank, which specializes on provision of services for corporate and
individual customers. Commercial banks by type can be universal and specialized.
Universal banks carry out all or almost all types of banking operations: provide both
short-term and long-term loans, accept deposits of all types, perform investing operations
and consultations, and provide all sorts of financial services to its customers. On the
contrary, specialized banks usually offer one or several types of banking operations.
In some countries, banking legislation prevents or simply prohibits a wide range of
transactions. As example of such prohibition, we can refer to famous “Banking Act of 1933”,
which forbid commercial banks to make investment operations until it was repealed in
1999.
</p><!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >     As for Europe, situation was more interesting. Firstly, European banking leaders were
United Kingdom, France and Germany. Glass-Steagall Act had some influence in Europe and
started discussions about role of universal banking and possibility of functional division of
banks. Nevertheless, general depression and major political changes did not lead
to such kind of laws, due to the increasing influence of government as well as rise
of authoritarianism. English banks observed increasing governmental control, while
German banks became a gear of national-socialist machine. For France, situation
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
was different, but equity markets were not as developed, so there were no movement
towards investment control. As example of similar act, we can observe Belgium, which
carried out a banking reform in 1934, which separated deposit banks and holding
companies.
</p><!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >     Development of European banking system and repeal of Banking Act of 1933 in the
United States in 1999 allowed us to observe next types of banks, by its functions:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">
      <!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >Commercial banks
      </p></li>
      <li class="itemize">
      <!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >Investment banks
      </p></li>
      <li class="itemize">
      <!--l. 31--><p class="noindent" >Universal banks </p></li></ul>
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >     As it was mentioned before, these days customers expect from commercial banks to have
various utility and agency services, not just basic functionality of accepting deposits and
providing loans. Escalation of competition in the global financial market, technological
changes and ever-increasing variety of customer needs have had and are expected
to continue to have an impact on banking management. The current stage in the
development of the banking services market is characterized by the introduction of new
banking services for both individuals and legal entities, an increase in the volume of
banking services and an increase in the importance of IT technologies in this sector.
What even more important, is the fact, that the banks themselves are interested in
providing that sort of services. This is due to the fact, that financial crisis of 2007-2008
showed to banks how it is important to have stable source of income. These secondary
functions allow banks to charge customers for their services, allowing to bank to lower
operational risk. Importance of secondary functions is growing due to the necessity of
more efficient management of working capital, risk management and liquidity. In
such case, focus on a client involvment for commercial banks became a favourable
solution.

divided by exterior departments — front office — which is responsible for client communication

responsible for operations execution and is a rearguard of a bank. With natural growth
commercial banks required additional functionality, a layer which would handle various
analytical work and would be a middleware between front office and back office — middle

<!--l. 108--><p class="indent" >     Front office — operational division of a bank and its other structural units, responsible for
management and development of relationships with counteragents. In front office occurs direct
communication with clients, primary verification of loaners’ data, collection analysis of received
documents, preparation of contracts with clients and other interoperations with counteragents.
Front office as a term also describes external interfaces, as instruments and rules of interaction
of the automated banking system with users and computer networks, in bank branches, in
which occurs direct work with clients and the conclusion of contracts and transactions of primar
banking business. Front office employees are responsible for customer attraction, customer
contact development and for a service to existing customers. As for card payment systems, front
office includes servicing ATM network and POS terminals, interacting with payment
card acceptance points and maintaining a network of self-service information devices.
Front offices continuously interact with the analytical and processing centers of the
system, middle office and back office. Typically, front office functions include client
communication, receiving and input of further processing client documents, providing the client
with information, calling and sending information messages to clients, processing
incoming calls. As an example of real front office units there are call centers, trading
and showrooms, customer service cash decks. Among digital front office units there
are customer self-service portals, personal accounts and internet banking, remote
banking systems, front-office supporting information systems, like CRMs (Customer
Relationship Management), ERPs (Enterprise Resource Management), CBSs (Core Banking
Systems).
</p><!--l. 117--><p class="indent" >     Middle office — bank division, which contains a set of business processes, procedures,
normative documents (regulations), reference books, printed forms, organizational and staff
documents that ensure the preparation and execution of decision-making processes. Middle
office units carry out verification and actual processing of client operations. Unlike the front
office, even though middle-office workers operations directly related to the client, as a rule,
those do not have direct contact with clients. Canonical examples of a middle office unit is a
risk management unit and a credit scoring unit. As an information systems middle-office use
position accounting system, borrower verification system, scoring calculation system,
etc.
</p><!--l. 122--><p class="indent" >     Back office — operational and accounting division of the bank, which guarantees the work
of the divisions involved in the asset and liabilities management, carries out the execution,
accounting and registration of the transactions with securities, as well as settlements with
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
customers.
</p><!--l. 124--><p class="indent" >     The tasks of the Back Office are credit affairs formation and direct loan issuance
processing, loan portfolio quality assessment, account opening, supporting accounting
operations, documentation and transactions support concluded by traders of counterparty
companies in the front office, etc. Depending on its structure, bback office may consist of one
division or may have a couple of units, united by documentation procedures, risk management,
accounting and calculations. However, certain banks may unite some functionaity with middle
office, as an example — risk management, which usually is understood as middle office activity,
as it structurally supports decision-making.
</p><!--l. 127--><p class="indent" >     As a conclusion, back office is a division which carries out other divisions involved
in asset and liabilities managment. Main back office task is the documentary and
electronic registration and maintenance of both market transactions and internal
analytcial transactions between organizational units within the framework of the
financial resource redistribution system. This is a support unit of the company which
performs administrative functions to help customer service personnel carry out their
duties.

</p><!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >     In general, Digital Banking is relatively new term and its definition is vaguely differed
from virtual and online banking. The concept of Digital Banking is based on digitalization of
banking services — making those available online. Currently, there are two major
ways of definition — inclusive and exclusive. Inclusive definition requires for banking
services to be digitalized and entirely available online. As a result, this definition
requires for every single element to be digitalized. Exclusive way requires banking
services to be available exceptionally in digital channels, as a contrast to traditional
banking, which is by default is not digitalized at all. By uniting both definitions we
can state, that digital banking is an ability to execute financial operations remotely
with a usage of personal electronic devices due to development of bank’s information
technologies.
</p><!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >     The most developed forms of digital banking are virtual banks, online banks and internet
banking. Virtual bank is a bank, which is accessible primarly via digital channels.
Basically, it is a bank, which is entirely placed in internet. In some cases it may have an
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
office for customers, most likely for branding purposes or for complicated and conflict
situations.
</p><!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >     Nevertheless, there are the most radical banks, which exist exclusively in internet and
provide services remotely. It is possible to confuse those with online banks, which are usually
just banks using internet as a form of client communication. In its turn, internet banking is
usually just an additional client interface as a form of a personal web app or mobile application
for banking operations.
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >     In the Digital Age of XXI Century, digitization of banking services is more of a business
requirement in modern market and financial sector evolution, then some overhyped technology.
Changes, that will be brought by digitization offer benefits for both financial institutuions and
customers. Firstly, it brings efficiency, as it requires digitalization on a core level, which allows
deriving from technology. Currently, banks assume being digital as a tool, and not a core
banking feature. Secondly, it brings cost efficiency. There are reports, which estimate that banks
can increase EBITDA margins by up to 40% on digital automation and removing
middlewares.
</p><!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >     Additionally, technology would allow to faster react on environmental changes on every
level. Banks, being slow responding to nature by nature, do not need to be that conservative on
every level of operation. As for front office, bank has to be agile to changes on a customer
market. At the same time, bank has to be agile enough to react to regulatory changes as fast as
it can. Furthemore, digital banking significantly changes levels and forms of competitiveness for
customer base. For banks, it is much easier to increase customer engagement as it would be able
to access various digital channels which customers are using. At the same time, it
would be much harder to obtain new customers without providing active competition
policy.
</p><!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >     Obviously, this is extremelly positive from a customer perspective. As a whole, customer
benefits are more obvious. Firstly, customers obtain more options, more choices, and are able to
freely switch between them. This includes both banking products and banks themselves.
Secondly, digital products are much easier to use. Customer should not come to a branch office
for basic banking operations. Moreover, for younger tech generations it is especially important
and usually an important argument on choosing bank to partner with. As a last point, due
to higher competition for a customer, the last may achieve various cost advantages
for increasing engagement, as for example, cashbacks or personally offered low loan
rates.
</p><!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >     Even though digital banking is considered relatively young, factically, it is a mature form
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
of retail banking. According to Deloitte, 81% of the most developed digital banking peers are
incumbents — banks with long-established position on the market. Among digital services, those
incumbents offer end-to-end support of opening and maintaining both transactional (debit card,
credit card, currency and current accounts), saving &#x0026; investment (saving and term accounts,
mutual funds) and credit (cash loan and overdraft) products digitally. All main players
offer API for developers and almost all of them offer FinTech accelerator program or
hold hackathons. This significantly increases involvement of third-parties in digital
banking, resulting in high level of interoperation, resulting in solutions in transactions
and personal account management. However, personally I assume that this target of
digital development is based on a PSD2 requirements, as, for example, only 22%
of top banks offer possibility to add accounts from other banks, as interintegration
between banks is not required by PSD2, even though it may positively affect bank
level of customer engagement. Moreover, banks with high level of digitization show
positive difference in various KPIs comparing to incumbent peers with lower levels of
digitization.
</p><!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >     As a next level of banking system development, digital banking adopters pioneer various
technolgies and enablers. The most common and naive is white label banking. White labelling
allows a bank, service provider, to provide banking business without product management and
distribution. White label client, co-branding partner, may offer banking product by its name,
while bank entirely takes responsibility for entire financial procedure. The most known
example of white labelling are branded credit cards. As a next stage, banks can offer
Banking-As-A-Service solutions. In this case, partners may use bank system as a logical and
functional component, while entire product can be created by third-parties. It may be
some sort of digital wallet, which requires bank to hold an account and to execute
transactions, while an application for this wallet and entire registration and product
distribution can be done by third-parties as middleware between bank and client. The
most demanding form of integration is Banking-as-a-Platform. Being a platform for
thirdparties, bank allows using core banking systems as a base, which allows building not
only products, but entire services on this base. The possibility to create such open
banking systems are the main target of such initatives as UK Open Banking project and
PSD2.
</p><!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >     In recent years, there has been an increasing need for more personalised and integrated
services for banking customers, but traditional banks have not been able to meet these
customers’ expectations.
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
</p><!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >     Based on researches, 45% of the American population, 62% of the British population and
67% of the Hong Kong population believe that banks are not meeting their needs.
</p><!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >     As a result, each region in the world (and their respective regulator) has been making
efforts towards increasing innovation within their banking industry.
</p><!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >     Many other regions in the world have been launching regulations or activities around
virtual banking and open banking in order to promote the convergence of technology and
banking in their own region.
</p><!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >     However, each region has used a different approach with its own flavour, timing or
implications. This report aims at exploring whether virtual banking licenses or open banking
regulation is the key to disrupt the retail banking industry, or whether it requires a bit of
both.
</p><!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >     It also serves to explore and examine the different policies and regulations in place that
disrupt the retail banking industry in the UK, Europe, US, Singapore and China whilst also
looking at what traditional banks are doing to cope with these specified regulations as well as
their respective success stories.
</p><!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >     As for Asian market, the most innovative and developing player is Hong Kong. The Hong
Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the key banking regulator, announced in September 2017
its intention to upgrade the current banking system to a new Smart Banking Era through the
launch of several initiatives, including the Virtual Banking license (which would allow an
entity to deliver retail banking services primarily through digital channels instead of
physical branches) and the Open API Framework (which is aimed at allowing thirdparty
service providers (TSP) to connect to and contact data exchange to the banks’ IT
systems).
</p><!--l. 84--><p class="indent" >     These initiatives will accelerate the speed of innovation in the banking industry in Hong
Kong. It will then evaluate the impact and effectiveness of the different systems and come to a
consensus of the main common element that seems to drive the change in the retail banking
ecosystem in each of these countries, and infer what it means and what would cause a similar
disruption in the Hong Kong retail banking market.

</p><!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >     In year 2007 European Parliament accepted directive, which aimed at regulation of
European market of online transactions and online banking. That document was called
Payment Service Directive — PSD.
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >     First revision of Payment Service Directive had created foundation for a common
payment market in the EU and the provision of payment services on high level of
security and the use of advanced technologies. It had set two sets of main rules, market
rules and business conduct rules. The market rules part had established a list of
organizations which could provide payment services. Additionally, this set declared
steps in order to be authorized as a payment institution, fulfilling certain capital and
risk management requirements. The business conduct rules part in its turn required
transparency on a business level. According to those rules any quantitative characteristics
of services providers, such as charges, exchange rates, transaction references and
execution times, should be obvious and transparent. Moreover, it defines rights and
obligations for both service providers and customers, such as revoking of payments and
refunds.
</p><!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >     The adoption of PSD1 had brought a list of significant benefits to the payments market.
Firstly, it had simplified market entry for new and small companies, as it specified obvious rules
and demanded from EU state authorities on various level to guarantee practical execution of
those rules. Additionally, level of responsibility became significantly clearer both for customers
and payment institutions, which lead to improved protection of payment rights of compensation
and refund.
</p><!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >     Obviously, transparent rules and open market had increased level of competitiveness, and,
consequently, business transparency overall increased, as well as reduction of both costs and
terms of payment execution. Of course, that had been a major positive impact for
customers.
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >     Nevertheless, PSD1 had remaining issues which had shown that there were
still place for development. PSD1 lacked direct instructions towards application of
certain provision of the directive, which lead to different interpretations by regulatory
authorities in EU member states. In a number of countries, this uncertainty had
resulted in deteriorating consumer protection and distortions in ensuring equal market
conditions.
</p><!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >     That problem had being especially expressed in provisions of the directive that defines
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
types of activities that are excluded from regulation. For example, services provided by a
limited network of suppliers, sales of limited goods and services categories. Same problem
concerned establishing fund refunding procedure in case of unauthorized debiting from a
customer account. Those provisions had been applied in different ways in different EU
countries.
</p><!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >     Moreover, since 2007, year of PSD1 adoption, there have been major changes in the retail
payments market, due to introduction of innovative technologies, the rapid growth of
transactions using electronic and mobile devices and the emergence of new types of payment
services, such as services for payment order execution and services for the financial information
consolidation. Consequently, many innovative products and services were wholly or largely
outside the scope of the PSD1, as such a development in the payment industry was not taken
into account.
</p><!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >     Furthermore, there was a significant increase in risks associated payments transaction via
electronic communication channels. In order to handle increase security threats, European
Banking Authority along with European Central Bank had issued guidelines on the security of
internet payments, which had set the minimum security requirements for money transfer
operators in the EU and was intended to provide additional protection for payment service
customers.
</p><!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >     However, regulator researches had shown a major influence of technological,
organizational and structural innovations on a market, which, in its turn, required
substantial documentation of a renewal of new approaches in payment operation services
and their interaction on a legislative level. Among those tendencies we may indicate:

<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >     Taking above-mentioned, and certain others issues into account, the European
Commission in July 2013 submitted a proposal to revise the PSD 1 directive. The purpose of
this initiative is to close existing regulatory gaps, bring the directive’s provisions in line with
modern technologies, improve data protection measures within the common market, and create
a fair and level playing field for money transfer operators.
</p><!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >     In year 2015, European Parliament accepted changes to PSD, resulting in a second version
of this directive — PSD2.  Basically, PSD2 directive aims to increase competition in the field of
user financial data access and make it possible to create open interfaces to work with user
financial data not only for big financial organizations, for example, banks, but also for young
and smaller FinTech startups.

information, as those types of services were not covered in the first PSD. Besides, directive
establishes unified rules for cross-border and payments within European Economic Area,
thereby ensuring fair competition between financial institutions and creates more transparent
rules for consumers of financial services. PSD2 provides terminology, which has to be described
for proper understanding of the process.

<!--l. 109--><p class="indent" >     Firstly, based on PSD2, EBA, GDPR and other standards and recommendations,
regulator oversees and builds relationship between three main participants of the directive —
ASPSP, TPP and PSU. The interaction between TPP and ASPSP is based on a non-contract
basis, as both participants are regulated by PSD2. This is important in order to keep the chain
of responsibilities working, as otherwise there could be many obstacles which would interfere
Open Banking. Relationship between TPP and PSU are based on PSD2 Consent. TPP is
obliged to request PSU consent to access client account. On an ASPSP side client has to
authorize based on PSD2 Consent, using SCA (Strong Customer Authentication) or DL
(Dynamic Linking) — authorization technologies determined by EU regulation on electronic
identification.
</p><!--l. 116--><p class="indent" >     Even though PSD2 presupposes high safety and integration in entire European banking, it
lacks implementation details. Open Banking Working Group, which had to deliver PSD2 as a
framework, intentionally made it as flexible as possible with multiple options, as it
allowed applying PSD2 in the fastest possible way in as many states and banks as
possible. On the other hand, this resulted in misconception in implementations of certain
banks and differences in interfaces for third-party providers., which led to need to
adapt to various application interfaces for each payment service for each third-party
provider.
</p><!--l. 120--><p class="indent" >     United Kingdom was the pioneer of Open Banking, where Competition and Markets
Authority (CMA) issued a ruling that required the nine-biggest UK banks to allow
licensed startups direct access to their data down to the level of transaction-account
transactions.
</p><!--l. 123--><p class="indent" >     Additionally, CMA issued a set of proposals for creation of a transparent banking services
system. Those set of proposals and requirements, often referenced to as Open Banking remedies,
have to be distinguished from Open Banking as an initiative, as those remedies describe only a
specific option and possible solution. To provide control over UK Open Banking implementation
CMA created special dedicated authority — Open Banking Implementation Entity. Comparing
to PSD2, UK Open Banking resolutions implement PSD2, but are much less flexible. PSD2, in
its turn, is a mandatory requirement for all payment account providers in European Union in
order to implement Open Banking as a concept. In general terms, PSD2 tells what has to
be done, while Open Banking implementation in UK determines how it has to be
done.

</p><!--l. 134--><p class="indent" >     Generally speaking, Open Banking is a concept of providing access to bank services and
customer data to third-party applications on customer request in safe and sound manner.  The
purpose of Open Banking is to improve quality of customer service and to allow third parties to
use and analyze financial data.
</p><!--l. 138--><p class="indent" >     Unfortunately, existing state of things, especially after financial crisis and international
“Too big to fail” policy, most of the regulators in different countries, as an example, CMA, had
next key conclusions:  </p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">
      <!--l. 141--><p class="noindent" >There   is   a   considerable   high   level   of   risk   concentration   due   to   market

<!--l. 146--><p class="indent" >     As a possible solution appeared an idea of Open Banking, which allows technological
development, change of attitude towards user data ownership, as it is reflected in GDPR and
Open data with Open API conceptions.
</p><!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >     As an example, we can take a main banking state in European region — United Kingdom.
UK got into hard situation, as critical concentration of client account was only in a couple of
banks. Historically, UK had survived the consequences of a number of reorganization of large
financial structures that cost around 37 billion of pounds. Consequently, UK had to do multiple
tasks: </p>

      <!--l. 156--><p class="noindent" >Decrease risk of creation of infamous backbone “too big to fail” institutions, which

<!--l. 167--><p class="indent" >     CMA gave a direct recommendation to 9 largest banks which hold the vast majority of
individual accounts in the country about the importance to creation of public API as well as
work on the coordination, implementation and support of the relevant standards in accordance
with the project plan approved by the CMA.
</p><!--l. 169--><p class="indent" >     The main instrument for competition stimulation in the financial market is aimed at
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
expanding the choice of financial products or services for consumers by providing access through
open programming interfaces, API.
</p><!--l. 171--><p class="indent" >     Obviously, for financial organizations Open Banking brings certain risks: </p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">
      <!--l. 173--><p class="noindent" >Implementation costs
      </p></li>
      <li class="itemize">
      <!--l. 174--><p class="noindent" >Support consts of open API

      </p></li>
      <li class="itemize">
      <!--l. 177--><p class="noindent" >Operational and legal risks </p></li></ul>
<!--l. 180--><p class="indent" >     However, among the biggest risks is a lack of infrastructure solutions. Bank becomes
supermarket on a platform. Every company has to know how to create a platform. Banks are
under pressure, which requires from them to create those platforms. They are underway, but
they lack scaling and prevalence. This is just a preparation stage for scaling. Some banks will
disappear, washed away by the wave. New distribution technologies would allow developing
other, more niche technologies.
</p><!--l. 189--><p class="indent" >     Bank as a service and bank as a platform. Bank can (and has) to create a model of a
platform, and to attract third-parties, pack their product into their service and offer those to
their clients. As a result, client would be able to use much more products.
</p><!--l. 193--><p class="indent" >     Undoubtedly, the initiative amplifies opportunities for creating new businesses.
Additionally, directive positions that a person’s financial data should belong to the
person himself and a person should have the right to dispose of this data at his own
discretion.
</p><!--l. 196--><p class="indent" >     As a conclusion, I have to mention that even though PSD2 and Open Banking result in
positive influence for everything related to online and digital banking, this lacks security.
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
Unfortunately, it may have negative effect over customer data, as third party companies may
not be secure enough to handle the responsibility of customer data handling, and it may result
in data leaks. In this case, making service more dynamic, PSD2 doesn’t help customers to
defend right of confidentiality of customer information. Regulatory measures in this case
are not enough and more serious decisions and more serious standards are needed.
Moreover, PSD2 even in conjunction with GDPR may leave customer alone with
both impregnable big transnational banks in case of data leak and young faceless
startups.
</p><!--l. 200--><p class="indent" >     From a client perspective, changes have been bringing major positive influences. Open
access will bring comfort and convenience in industry.
</p><!--l. 203--><p class="indent" >     Firstly, this significantly accelerates development of digital banking. Technologies have
already become a part of life and exist everywhere. Of course, there have been tendencies in
traditional banking for a long time in movement towards digital banking, as technologies
became much more available and develop significantly faster.
</p><!--l. 207--><p class="indent" >     Secondly, banks should adapt to existing and future clients, as it is not the client which
was 20 years ago. Nowadays, client has much higher demands towards products and its
accessibility. Moreover, technologies dictate new forms of client communication, such as social
networks and various messenger apps. What is even more interesting, is that those new
communication channels are not just some public places, like street or internet, but some
private platforms, social networks, on mobile devices.
</p><!--l. 212--><p class="indent" >     Both technologies, clients, communication and data have been developing and progressing
towards Open Banking.

<tspan font-family="ec-lmbx" font-size="12">1.3.3.</tspan><tspan font-family="ec-lmbx" font-size="12">    Conclusion</tspan>
</p><!--l. 219--><p class="indent" >     PSD2 by itself was a major initiative, which mostly stimulated development of Open
Banking, as main purpose of this document was to build a structural set of requirements in
order make a regulated platform for implementation of Open Banking.
</p><!--l. 221--><p class="indent" >     Even though PSD2 is a requirement, the document by itself is pretty abstract, which
results in different concrete implementations by default. However, this can be solved by both
state regulator, as in UK, or by third-party middleware, which could offer unified
API.
</p><!--l. 224--><p class="indent" >     In fact, Open Banking is a system which is based on API. Using various API providers
companies can combine services to improve customer experience. API is a programming
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
interface from a set of ready-made functions or structures that are provided by an application or
service. Public API — is a public available set of programming instruments, which allow
application interaction.
</p><!--l. 229--><p class="indent" >     As a rule, Open API is being used for partly integration on various services and in order
to use independent services as a dependency. Open API allows third-party developers to access
and use service’s functionality. API became a product and a bank service, which allows
developing platforms compatible with the API. This allows developers and third-parties to
connect to a bank. Bank as well may use such service for own operations and business. At the
same time, the way banking business is being done today and will be done in 30 years will
drastically differ.
</p><!--l. 236--><p class="indent" >     The best illustration of such concept is that banks have API platform and FinTech—companies
may connect to bank via this API platform. Bank agrees on FinTech services usage and offers it
to its customers. Open Banking Platform — business-platform, which takes data from
third-parties and offers it to its clients. Why would third-parties be interested in this? This is a
main question, as connection with banks is a question which exists outside their main activity.
And there are no confirmed cases on interest from part of third-parties to get data from banks
and to offer it to their clients. Assuming thinking as a commercial platform, there is a
definitive reason why clients do use platform services — commerical platform’s main
product.
</p><!--l. 243--><p class="indent" >     Banks have to offer something similar to API platform and to open a window for
third-party companies and developers, which will integrate and could interact with a system
without banks’ actions.
</p><!--l. 245--><p class="indent" >     Basically, PSD2, Open Banking and API form 3 levels of abstraction, where PSD2
answers the question &#x0022;what has to be done&#x0022;, regional level directives, for example,
Open Banking Remedy is &#x0022;how it has to be done&#x0022; and API shows final result of this
directive.
</p><!--l. 247--><p class="indent" >     Big data is the last component, which is extremely important for business, is everywhere
and is a part of both business and business decisions. Undoubtedly, modern FinTech projects
desperately need this type of data. It is impossible to imagine modern financial advisor
application in which user has to manually enter accounts and investment portfolios. There have
already been FinTech solutions targeting this problem and entire Data Aggregation, allowing to
obtain unified access to data.
</p><!--l. 252--><p class="indent" >     Even larger volume of data becomes available, and based on what it is possible to
create client recommendations. Internet-platforms additionally can offer financial
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
services and information to clients. However, client comes to this portal for specific
services. Therefore, there is no guarantee that Open Banking would have influence.
Open Banking is not just a word, that shows openness, but an operational banking
philosophy. This requires to create new concept of banking, which is hard to understand
for banks. In this context banks has to change it structure, business architecture,
they have to make digital technologies as a basement of their system. This means,
that banks must make the transition from traditional banking to new novel future
banking. Banks have to understand simple things — philosophy, strategy, what they have
to develop in their business, and if they have a team for this. Those are obvious,
but banks have to pass through all the stages. Otherwise, banks won’t be able to
move from old to new. Open Banking is an entire change of strategy and vision of a
banking development for the next 5-10 years, but innovations have to be implemented
today.
</p><!--l. 265--><p class="indent" >     There is an opinion that FinTech is in competition with banks, but it is not entirely true.
Banks have history, brand, reputation, guarantees and experience. FinTech companies do not
have it. On the other hand, FinTech has great products, which creates ideal conditions for
cooperation, not for competition From a side of client interaction banks can and must work
with FinTech, in order to offer those great products to bank clients. Obviously, FinTech won’t
solve all banking industry problems.

<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent" >Most of the work in banking industry, which is not connected to human interaction, is
over-documented and formalized. Having sufficient amount of input data and knowing
what kind of output is required it is possible to create a formalized determined way
of how to obtain output from input. This determined formalized way is called an
algorithm.
</p><!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >     Main problem of common algorithms is, as it comes of definition, is that it is impossible
for an algorithm to solve problems, for which it is not designed.
</p><!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >     Nevertheless, it is possible to create an algorithm, that can adapt to changing environment
based on previous results. To find out how to use collect, process and analyze existing data of
previous states of environment and corresponding result we can use various statistical
instruments. Aside general statistics, of course, one is able to use tools of data science and
machine learning.
</p><!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >     As a result, it is possible to create a system, which would be able taking into account
primary input data and its own past output data produce new adapted output data
corresponding to ever-changing environment. Thus, having a system which is able to serve
decisions, which were not available or known before, we can call this system intelligent. As a
result, we could tell that we had an Artificial Intelligence — AI. According to European
Parliament, Artificial Intelligence refer to systems that display intelligent behavior by analyzing
their environment and taking action with some degree of autonomy in order to achieve
specific goals.  AI is typically defined as the ability of a machine to perform cognitive
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
functions we associate with human minds, such as perceiving, reasoning, learning, and
problem-solving. Examples of technologies that enable AI to solve business problems are
robotics and autonomous vehicles, computer vision, language, virtual agents, and machine

</p><!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >     One of the earliest versions of computer intelligence implementations were Decision
Support Systems. Decision Support Systems are interactive, computer-based systems that aid
users in judgment and choice activities. They provide data storage and retrieval, but enhance
the traditional information access and retrieval functions with support for model building and
model-based reasoning. They support framing, modeling, and problem-solving. Decision support
systems are typically used for strategic and tactical decisions faced by upper-level
management—decisions with a reasonably low frequency and high potential consequences—in
which the time taken for thinking through and modeling the problem pays off generously in the
long run.
</p><!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >     There are three fundamental components of Decision Support Systems: database
management system — DBMS, model-base management system — MBMS, and dialog generation
and management system — DGMS.
</p><!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >     A DBMS serves as a data bank for the Decision Support System. It stores large
quantities of data that are relevant to the class of problems for which the DSS has
been designed and provides logical data structures (as opposed to the physical data
structures) with which the users interact. A DBMS separates the users from the
physical aspects of the database structure and processing. It should also be capable of
informing the user of the types of data that are available and how to gain access to
them.
</p><!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >     The role of MBMS is analogous to that of a DBMS. Its primary function is providing
independence between specific models that are used in a DSS from the applications that use
them. The purpose of an MBMS is to transform data from the DBMS into information that is
useful in decision-making. Because many problems that the user of a DSS will cope with may
be unstructured, the MBMS should also be capable of assisting the user in model
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
building.
</p><!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >     The main product of an interaction with a DSS is insight. Because their users are often
managers who are not computer trained, DSSs need to be equipped with intuitive and
easy-to-use interfaces. These interfaces aid in model building, but also in interaction with the
model, such as gaining insight and recommendations from it. The primary responsibility of a
DGMS is to enhance the ability of the system user to use and benefit from the DSS.
In the remainder of this entry, we use the broader term user interface rather than
DGMS.
</p><!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >     First attempts to create and use AI in Decision Support Systems by banks had started in
60s-70s. Back then, it sounded as something definitely impossible. Unfortunately,
existing state of science wasn’t able to satisfy banks’ needs and first experience of AI
implementation was done only a few decades later. The pioneer of implementation of
Artificial Intelligence System was Citibank. Specialists of this company made an
attempt to implement an automatic Decision Support System that could be as effective,
as human experts and more cost-effective. Generally, Citibank had gotten positive
summary.
</p><!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >     As a result, leading banks in the United States tried to apply and implement AI as their
business solution. However, due to, comparing with present, low level of development of
information technologies, banks found application of AI economically unjustified. Banks
did not invest in continuing researches and for the couple of decades forgot about
AI.

</p><!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >     Historically, banks became large financial entities with lots of regulations over them. This
requires from banks humongous levels of responsibility and accountability. Consequently, banks
are known as owners of enormous amount of data, which may be required by regulators, as well
as by clients. Nevertheless, banks are highly interested in using those amount of data for
business purposes. However, both collecting, maintaining, processing input data and using
output results is not a simple set of operation. Having mainly numerical data in
digital form, this set of operation requires significant work in terms of Mathematics,
Statistics and Computer Science. This becomes extremely complicated due to previously
mentioned gigantic amounts of data, which can easily overpass 1 Terabyte of data a
day.
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
</p><!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >     Therefore, that was not a surprise, that Commercial Banking was always keeping its eye
on evolution of related technologies.
</p><!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >     Even though, banks were using synergy of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer
Science since 1950s with varied success, the latest big forward jump was in early
2010s.
</p><!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >     By then, ability to accumulate and process large amounts of data became essential for
multiple industries, not only the one, that historically accumulate data.  Those large amounts of
data are usually referred to as Big Data. Big Data are information assets characterized by such
a High Volume, Velocity and Variety to require specific Technology and Analytical Methods for
its transformation into Value.
</p><!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >     Since early 2010s, consumer banks started adoption of fast growing Big Data technologies.
Banks, historical owners of enormous amounts of data, were extremely interested in
Big Data solutions and specialists. Even though Big Data solves problems regarding
collection, maintenance and preprocessing of data, additional tools are required for
general processing, data usage and application. Those tools are provided by Machine
Learning.
</p><!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >     Most recent advances in AI have been achieved by applying machine learning to very large
data sets. Machine Learning algorithms detect patterns and learn how to make predictions and
recommendations by processing data and experiences, rather than by receiving explicit
programming instruction. The algorithms also adapt in response to new data and experiences to
improve efficacy over time.
</p><!--l. 77--><p class="indent" >     Obviously, even after decades of research and development those technologies had been
still considered as a bit risky. Therefore, banks had decided to start with something, that would
allow reducing costs or optimizing non-operational activity.
</p><!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >     On June 2016, agency Reuters issued an article, in which it mentioned that banks of Wall
Street in order to try to decrease costs were looking into software development, so it could help
to optimize and to speed up the process of searching suitable employees. For highest
performance and due to unpredictable results, banks had bet on Artificial Intelligence. AI
technologies would allow discovering and identify in applicants such qualities, that would be
proficient for employer, including ability to works in a team, with a big purpose, willpower, and
other soft skills, that, probably, wouldn’t be mentioned in CV or could be found out during
interview process. Hires of bad candidates can cost a lot for a company and lead to large
financial expenses and influences negatively for company’s business possibilities. According to
experts of Capital One Financial, those losses in average are three salaries of a person, who
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
could fit perfectly for this job. In such cases self-developing algorithms may allow its clients to
get rid of such human errors, as screening out strong candidates, that may look weak
at once. The possibility of implantation of AI to a common process is being under
consideration by such financial giants as Goldman Sachs Group, Morgan Stanley,
Citigroup and UBS Group. UBS Group had started using algorithms, that allows to
analyze CVs and to find tough candidates as well. Goldman Sachs Group had used its
own software to find specific qualities in CVs, for example, teamwork, honesty and
judiciousness. Furthermore, it uses personality tests for better understanding of qualities of
successful bankers and traders. Some banks used third-party solutions. For example,
Citigroup in June 2016 started testing technology, developed by third-party, to dropout
candidates. Software had been tested on a small group of employees, who had been working
in corporate and investment departments. The application determines, so called,
“corporate imprint” — certain set of qualities of existing employees, which should lead to
high corporate performance — and evaluates qualities of candidate based on small
video, on which job seekers are talking about their strengths and aspirations in career.
That system takes into account not only specific features of job seeker’s speech, but
also one’s skill to present his speech, including body language and rate of speech.
Previously, technologies allowed and helped to find out the best CV, while nowadays it
allows understanding people, that apply for a job. Such solutions give a possibility to
drastically remove expenses for unsuccessful hiring and improve the situation on labor
market. In general, Artificial Intelligence allow selecting candidates, that will be able to
execute needed work, as it can create templates, based on analysis of big volumes of
data.
</p><!--l. 101--><p class="indent" >     It may seem, that the changes affected only European and US banks, but AI became a
main trend on Asian markets as well. In Japan, by the end of 2017, it became known about the
plans of leading Japanese banks to automate about 30 thousand workplaces until 2027. Bank
boards reached a conclusion, that automatization is inevitable, due to the fact, that traditional
methods of making business would not help in increasing incomes. It would allow minimizing
costs of labor capital and direct it to fields, where human workforce would be more
valuable.
</p><!--l. 106--><p class="indent" >     Those banks assumed, that existing, traditional, business model didn’t allow increasing
financial gains. Leading Japanese banks and financial companies, Mizuho Financial Group,
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, informed about
readiness to automate more than 30 thousand working places.
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
</p><!--l. 110--><p class="indent" >     According to Nikkei, Mizuho Financial Group are going to replace around 8 thousand
employees with computers and increase that number up to 19 thousand. Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group started moving towards large-scale automation. Based on their plans,
they were expecting to automate around 4 thousand workplaces by the end of 2020.
Group considered consolidating various clerical work to minimize amount of staff with
duplicating duties. Moreover, around 100 generic routine work tasks would be done by new
robotized processing system, that previously had been used by Mizuho Financial
Group only for data inputting on opening new investment accounts on its website.
What is even more important, large-scale digitalization did not imply layoffs. For
example, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group started its transformation by transferring
around 200 back office employees to customer service departments. Besides, Mizuho
Financial Group intends to increase the number of financial technology specialists.
Mitsubishi UFJ keeps up with competitors and plans to automate 9500 jobs up to FY
2023.
</p><!--l. 121--><p class="indent" >     Nowadays, the largest market, that uses AI as a solution in the banking sector, remains
North America.
</p><!--l. 123--><p class="indent" >     In June 2018 Bank of America announced start of research process of using of Machine
Learning or currency strategies analysis. Announced reason for the research was the unstable
political situation in Italy — experts feared that it would have a negative influence both on Euro
and other European currencies, and this threatens to create new financial crisis. In the
first research Bank of America algorithms of Machine Learning were evaluated by
performance of working with fundamental and review data, that involve, for example,
governmental costs and expectation of consumer. The main task of an AI is to create a
forecast of relationships of euro and dollar pair. Due to the nature of the foreign
exchange market, it’s rather difficult to forecast using only known situations, and
as a result Machine Learning may allow identifying unexpected existing unknown
patterns.
</p><!--l. 130--><p class="indent" >     As other banks, Wells Fargo &#x0026; Company applied Artificial Intelligence in Front Office for
customer experience and in Middle Office, for anti-money laundering. Nevertheless, Wells
Fargo &#x0026; Company declared that it additionally adheres to a fundamental economic
approaches for analysis of foreign exchange markets, as it trusts its experience in this
field.
</p><!--l. 134--><p class="indent" >     As an example, commercial bank Morgan Stanley hired Michael Kearns, professor of
Applied Informatics in Pennsylania University, who had been working in a hedge fund
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
previously, in order to expand the use of AI, while research team of Deutsche Bank had started
using Machine Learning for its data analysis.
</p><!--l. 136--><p class="indent" >     On the other side, some players did not want to take a risk. JP Morgan Financial Holdings
Research Group had been studying applications for Machine Learning for a long
time, but had not decided to use it until year 2021. Only in first half of 2021 JP
Morgan hired 50 artificial intelligence experts and plans to hire at least 160 more
professionals.
</p><!--l. 141--><p class="indent" >     The fact, that banks are more actively using Artificial Intelligence in applied work was
confirmed by Deloitte. Based on Deloitte research, 29% of financial companies, working in
different countries, automate most of monotonic routine processes, 25% respondents use such
technologies for risk management, 21% — for generating risk reports, 20% — for regulatory
reporting.
</p><!--l. 150--><p class="indent" >     The Financial Times made special survey for 30 largest banks, which confirmed a close
interest and an understanding of resulting impact of swift implementation of modern operation
technologies. Among 18 banks, 17 do already use Artificial Intelligence in clients
communication, as it is on this site that they see the most obvious benefits. 8 banks
use AI in all structural divisions in any form. 5 expecting in future to have special
divisions, which will focus on AI. 8 involved in joint development with specialized
companies. Moreover, 4 of those even invested into companies, which are exploring
AI.
</p><!--l. 160--><p class="indent" >     Big data and data analysis are still prioritized for banks, as 40% of respondents use it in
everyday data processing. Around 25% of respondents declared usage of Machine Learning and
19% of Cognitive Analytics, including Natural Language Processing, in order to decrease
costs and increase operational accuracy, while 24% of asked banks use it for Business
Intelligence.
</p><!--l. 165--><p class="indent" >     All over the world, in general in 2018 banks income due to application of Artificial
Intelligence was around $41.1 billion. It is important to note, that this amount contains both
direct income from implementation of AI technologies, but also an amount of decreased costs
and benefits due to increased work effectiveness of various financial structures, comparing with
work effectiveness using same old processes and infrastructures. And according to market
forecasting this income will only grow.

<!--l. 179--><p class="indent" >     Even though, as previously mentioned, United States banks are leaders of Artificial
Intelligence application, where companies earned additional $14.7 billion in 2018
thanks to those technologies, experts expect that by 2024 the Asia-Pacific region will
break out into the lead, as banks expect to earn and save, thanks to AI, around $50.6
billion, while in 2018 those banks saved $11.5 billion. By 2030 it will raise up to $98.6
billion due to demand in China (including Hong Kong), Japan, South Korea and
Singapore.
</p><!--l. 183--><p class="indent" >     According to forecasters, by 2030 banks in the whole world would be able to decrease costs
by 22% using Artificial Intelligence technologies. In numbers, this reduction can reach $1
trillion.
</p><!--l. 187--><p class="indent" >     According to Accenture, the amount of savings by 2035 will be nearly $1.2
trillion.
</p><!--l. 190--><p class="indent" >     The most tangible changes will occur in units that have direct contact with
customers. By reducing amount of retail divisions, cashiers and security officers, banks cut
costs by $490 billion. In departments responsible for data processing, analytics and
reports, introduction of Artificial Intelligence will save up to $350 billion in middle
office and $200 billion in back office. In the US banking sector, more than 1.2 million
of employees have already encountered AI, even thought they may not be aware of
it.
</p><!--l. 197--><p class="indent" >     Nevertheless, AI technologies should change structure of financial industry, making bank
sector more humane and intelligent.
</p><!--l. 200--><p class="indent" >     The profit for the bank is obvious, as it will result in significant cost reduce. However,
forecasts about employment in front banking are much less optimistic. Recent study of
Autonomous Research have shown, that AI can lead to 1.3 million employees losing their jobs in
the United States and 500 thousand employees in Great Britain.
</p><!--l. 204--><p class="indent" >     Former CEO of Citigroup, Vikram Pandit, who is considered as FinTech evangelist,
assume that 30% of bank employees can be replaced by Artificial Intelligence in near future.
The threat of layoffs is real for existing bank employees. Former CEO of Deutsche Bank told,
that they intend to replace 98 thousand of workers with smart software solutions, while
Japanase Mizuho Financial Group will free 19 thousand of workplaces, third of entire stuff, by
2027.
</p><!--l. 211--><p class="indent" >     IHS Market assumes, that among bank employees, who can lose workplaces, the biggest
risk is for B2C front-office workers, especially, cashiers, customer service, interviewers, clerks,
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
financial managers, controllers and credit specialists.
</p><!--l. 215--><p class="indent" >     Even though usage of Machine Learning for complex analysis is not an innovation,
according to Vasant Dhar, Informatics Professor in New York University and founder of SCT
Capital Management Hedge Fund, which has been applying AI for 20 years, foreign exchange
markets are still a significant challenge for AI algorithms and modelling. Complexity and variety
of macroeconomic factors, which can have influence on inter-currency relations, crucially
complicate analysis for foreign exchange markets, unlike regular stock markets that has been
using AI and ML for a long time.
</p><!--l. 218--><p class="indent" >     Main criticism of AI is based on lack of trust to results, as ML supposes Black Box
analysis and finding interconnections in unpredictable ways. Therefore, most of the critics
cannot accept prognostic findings to AI, as it processes data without building relationships
between cause and effect.
</p><!--l. 222--><p class="indent" >     Despite rational enormous cost savings, a number of researchers are recommending to step
off radicalism. In their opinion, banks should be careful not to rely too much on new solutions.
Its effectiveness is extremely clear only in case of complementing human work, not replacing.
Therefore, introducing artificial intelligence, banks should be prepared at least to educate
employees of robotized work process. Large Dutch bank ING agrees with this position: “We
would like to use artificial intelligence in order to suggest more thoughtful decisions to our
clients and to be more effective in decision-making, and not to replace workforce with
AI”.
</p><!--l. 231--><p class="indent" >     On this direction there is a temptation to improve the artificial intelligence, making its
possibilities closer to human ones. Unfortunately, much still remains outside the perimeter of
capabilities of modern technologies. AI has a function of recognition, but not of cognition. It is
wrong to assume that humans and machines can work on a same level. It would be a long way,
and it would require significant research until machines begin to at least approaching level of
human performance. Predictions regarding the timing of the creation of truly “smart” intellect
are pretty vague.
</p><!--l. 240--><p class="indent" >     Doubts arise not only in terms of timing. Considerably more important are considerations
of a generalized and even philosophical nature, for example, whether it is generally necessary to
strive to model human thinking in its entirety. The spheres of application of human
and machine intelligence should coexist in complementarity, and not repression (or
replacement) In a number of situations, there are no simple tasks that can be solved purely
algorithmically, but a human mind is needed to cope with them. However, humanizing
artificial intelligence deprives it of those strengths, for which, actually, human tries to
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
create and swap himself with rational, algorithmic and objective source of actions and
decisions.
</p><!--l. 246--><p class="indent" >     Digital economics brings changes not only to operational bank activities, but also into
relationships within community of financial institutions.
</p><!--l. 248--><p class="indent" >     Research conducted by World Economic Forum together with Deloitte and Touché led to
the conclusion that possibilities, which are being brought by Artificial Intelligence are an
option only for the largest banks. Since the main innovation concentrate on customer
acquisition channels, then it is very likely to observe banking sector regroup — the
dominance of large structures and the withdrawal from the market of small and medium
structures.
</p><!--l. 252--><p class="indent" >     However, researchers leave small companies a chance on survival. Those assume that
smaller companies have an option to specialize in certain directions, types of operations and
specific clients. Consequently, along with large banks, customer service in digital economics may
be provided by small niche financial companies.
</p><!--l. 257--><p class="indent" >     The desire of benefit by expending of information base and Artificial Intelligence, which is
the main data consumer, will lead to creation of monopolies — large alliances of financial groups.
The need of strengthening and enhancement of bank cooperation is required by increasing
importance of analytical work, grow of risks of cyber-attacks and fraudulent schemes. The
effectiveness of protection against criminals significantly increases in the conditions of
sharing information about criminal patterns, sharing blacklists of companies and
clients.
</p><!--l. 261--><p class="indent" >     Nonetheless, transfer, control and usage of received data has to be settled down, including
legal establishment. Data owners, as well as clients, are interested in reliable control over
data. As a result, there is a need in obvious legal procedure of personal data transfer
and its protection. The transfer of activities to digital space creates entirely new
risks and requires new methods of risk countering, which have not been worked out
yet.
</p><!--l. 266--><p class="indent" >     At the group level banks agree on a fact, that main route of development of banking is
based on implementation of opportunities offered by digital economics. Moreover, banks apply
the latest achievements of computer technologies and software development, among them
Artificial Intelligence, in individual areas of its work, replacing an employee with

</p><!--l. 273--><p class="indent" >     Even nowadays, banks are still focused on creating necessary conditions for AI
transformations, including preparation of infrastructure, data, models and processes. In
addition to fields, that always have to be on the cutting edge, in order to gain advantage
as a pioneer, changes are coming to more conservative spheres of financial services.
Despite the active usage of Artificial Intelligence, most banks have not had time to
implement it globally yet. According to experts, overwhelming majority of financial
institutions noted usage of Machine Learning in one degree or another, but, as it
had been noted by experts, only 20% of respondents went beyond the basics of AI
usage.
</p><!--l. 280--><p class="indent" >     But structurally, banks were creating single open platforms, which provide general service
for all domestic business customers. Therefore, there is a need in relevant professionals, who
would be able to handle and support platforms.

</p><!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >     Nowadays, banks are equipped with modern information and communication technologies.
At the same time mentioned technologies, including Fin-Tech software, have significant
impact over existing financial institutions. By surpassing operational limitations, those
technologies become the main factor of transformation of both in a case of single
bank, and in a case of entire banking sector. This results in a gradual increase of
computerization of banking industry, leading to larger possibilities of application of artificial
intelligence.
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >     Significant volumes of information are being accumulated over financial markets resulting
in data analysis being more and more relevant. Some experts note, that markets are already
emerging where data sharing is critical to competitive success and first movers are positioned to

obviously, investment banking companies, which had to apply modern solutions in day trading
algorithms. Those companies target Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing

</p><!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >     As for commercial banking, the status of AI integration highly depends on bank size.
All over the globe major financial players have been developing solutions based on
Artificial Intelligence for the last 60 years with the various levels of success. The
situation has been especially progressive for the last 10 years. In general, over 70% of
large global banks studied and have implemented AI for front-office or back-office
functions.
</p><!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >     However, as for middle-size financial institutions, situation seems pessimistic.
While largest banks have been developing AI strategies, creating teams and projects
in place by investing billions of dollars, for midsize banks AI was not even on the
radar.
</p><!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >     In comparison, while large banks have been investing majorly since 2016, in 2020 less than
20% of midsize, or less, financial institutions invested in, implemented, or at least planned to
apply AI. What is even worse, only 2% of those have deployed chat-bots, Machine Learning or
other Artificial Intelligence technologies.
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
</p><!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >     The main reason is in AI capital limitations. Even though, those technologies can be
independent of existing business structure, the last are highly dependent of capital investments.
Therefore, large financial institutions Banks that act now can capitalize on the power of
automation and intelligence to truly transform their organizations.
</p><!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >     Midsize and smaller banks and financial institutions have to compete with mega-sized
counterparts without R&#x0026;D budgets. What is even worse, the gap between large and non-large
institutions only increase, because of how AI works. The longer AI operates, the smarter
and more useful it becomes. As a result, the longer financial institutions wait, the
harder it becomes to catch up. Financial institutions that start early gain a head
start of months—even years—to gather data and “train” their self-learning, intelligent
applications.
</p><!--l. 58--><p class="indent" >     Consequently, currently Artificial Technologies are available mostly to big players.
</p><!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >     However, for midsize and smaller institutions not everything is lost, as there is a
third-party option. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence is highly used in start-ups, and
application of solutions of those may save capital for research and development, and would
allow applying tested solutions. Secondly, most AI start-ups are small. Pilot programs and
third-party innovation labs give banks and credit unions a chance to test, learn and refine
your AI initiatives for a relatively small cost, before seeking funding for full-scale
roll-outs.
</p><!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >     However, one of the most important question of this analysis is what should banking
acknowledge as Artificial Intelligence, what are its forms and possible use-cases in
practice.
</p><!--l. 68--><p class="indent" >     Currently, there is an extremely wide range of opinions. Due to lack of unified theoretical
platform of banking services, forecasts of development of banking institutions based on AI differ
drastically and are based on business strategies of every single bank. Nevertheless, there are 2
main routes of development. First route is about focusing on cost reduction by workforce
replacement and automatization of repeating routine operations without significant
reformations of existing organizational structure.
</p><!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >     On the other hand, there is a perspective in new digital technologies, which may allow
inventing and introduce qualitatively different business models based on new market challenges,
and, as a result, developing brand-new sources of income.
</p><!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >     Nevertheless, in general, Artificial Intelligence in banks can be used in lots of areas. From
bank’s perspective AI is needed from its ability to harness bank data in three key ways: to
analyze, to act, and to improve by self-learning.
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
</p><!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >     Systems of Artificial Intelligence were developed for automation of clerical workload, other
routine paperwork, processing of various data sets. In the digital age, banking transaction
operations are just a form of abstraction over data transfer and storage. Even though largest
banks prefer to save more traditional organizational structure, they actively embed digital
technologies in everyday practice. Even though, banks prefer a less risky way, Artificial
Intelligence application is applied in all bank fields, on all office levels and has to be precisely
analyzed on each of those levels.

</p><!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >     Both Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning may have significant influence on entire
Back Office of Commercial banking. Back office is known for enormous amount of repeating
actions due to Execution, Clearing and Settlement process. Therefore, the primary appliance of
AI is in automatization of repeating routine operations. Automated solutions, that
automatically builds behavior patterns is ideal of Back Office, as it initiates high back-office
efficiency via automation.
</p><!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >     Ironically, this case is the case, when human intervention can impact more negatively,
than positively. For repeating actions, for example, calculations, in which there is no responsible
decision-making, artificial intelligence suits the most. “For repetitive tasks without variability
(in middle office, in back end) for clearing/settlement/operational processes that
are not particularly in need of smarts, then AI approaches are great,” says Pascal
Bouvier, a venture partner at Santander InnoVentures, a fintech venture capital fund of
the Spanish bank that invests in early stage Fin-Techs including those focused on
AI.
</p><!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >     Special attention of applied automatization is directed into processes, that require large
amount of work, but offer low profitability. McKinsey shows as an example of JP Morgan, which
had started using chat-bots for IT service request automatization. In 2017 1.7 million of
requests where processed this way, which is equal to yearly full-time workforce of 40
employees.
</p><!--l. 106--><p class="indent" >     In fact, it is possible for bank to transfer to robotic solutions such operations as:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">

<!--l. 116--><p class="indent" >     Another popular application is processing of incoming documents. Modern scanning
programs can recognize standard documents and transfer them to performers. Naturally,
this kind of programs contain special filters, which direct documents, that do not
fit into specific characteristics, for expert review. Moreover, modern systems allow
recognizing most typical types of documents and fill it using typical forms. This allows a
practical usage of these tools for legal office and even compliance control divisions. As a
result, activity of institutions become aligned to established regulations. However,
undeniable benefits of automatization based on artificial intelligence can be fully
achieved and felt only in case of continuous update and upgrade of technological
base.
</p><!--l. 125--><p class="indent" >     As an example of direct application, it is possible to refer to remittance matching
solutions, that improve straight-through processing. As an example, Deluxe offers AI based

</p><!--l. 134--><p class="indent" >     In comparison to Back Office, where AI may be used primarly for infrastuctural changes
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
and evolution, Middle office is open for the biggest cost cuts and optimizations. According to
researches, Middle Office alone can save $217 billion, around 50% of all cost savings available by
AI for banks by 2023.
</p><!--l. 138--><p class="indent" >     The reason for this is hidden in a definition of Middle office by itself. Middle office is
comparably new division of a commercial bank, and usually forms a bridge between customer
flexible Front and strict and executive Back office. Hence, Middle office operations by its nature
are structured and documented, but have a certain level of statistical disturbance. Thus, it
makes Middle-office the most interesting and sensible target for AI development for commercial
banking.
</p><!--l. 143--><p class="indent" >     Importance is based on a combination of possible backfire of operation logic and
unpredicatable patterns, that can form in everyday work. This leads to, probably, the
most obvious area for AI in Middle office — Credit Scoring. AI in this case allows
calculating credit scores not only based on known mathematical models, but to find out
new, previously unknown patterns. As an example, credit risks for private clients
can be analyzed based on user’s digital footprint, that can reach enormous amount
of data. Moreover, this may be true for clients, who have no credit history, or very
old credit history, as it would allow to set a credit score based on a data of other
clients.
</p><!--l. 149--><p class="indent" >     Secondly, AI has a major usage in Anti-fraud. Practically, it has the same reason to use as
for Credit Scoring — it is possible to unite existing models with unpredictable patterns. In this
case model can analyze not just payment data, transaction history, transaction time and
location, but in a various combinations based on possible patterns of transactions of other users.
Additionally, AI supports and provides face recognition systems. As for ATMs, all actions can
be guaranteed by face recognition. It is true for Internet Banking for customers and CRM for
bank employees as well.
</p><!--l. 156--><p class="indent" >     Furthermore, the same reasoning is true for both KYC and AML compliance. In general,
Artificial Intellegence brings multiple possibilities for KYC and AML, such as unified pool of
data, probabilistic matching, progressive evolution, self-training and pattern-based analytics in
conjunction with rule-based. Moreover, these features allow using AI in Risk Management, for
credit and risk underwriting.
</p><!--l. 162--><p class="indent" >     Based on existing estimations, around 20% of digitalization projects are targeting cost
reduction or productivity increase. Most of those are targeting on potential risks recognition
and minimization of risk consequences.
</p><!--l. 166--><p class="indent" >     Artificial intelligence may frame out unlawful behavior, including non-stereotypical one.
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
By processing big data artificial intelligence may find out an evidence of fraud or illegally
money laundering attempt. The most simple way, but still significant, criminal pattern
identification and revealing unlawful activity.
</p><!--l. 170--><p class="indent" >     Artificial Intelligence can cover large databases and catch patterns, which hide from
human attention. Even more complicated approach of AI usage is educating to identifying
market noises. As a result, more advanced technologies allow discovering and determine people
and companies with elevated risk for banks, allowing to build safer relationships with them in
future.
</p><!--l. 174--><p class="indent" >     Crimes in virtual banking are evaluated in $600 billions yearly. Artificial Intelligence and
Machine Learning as main instruments for risk management in banking practice are mainly
oriented on financial crime prevention. This is much more efficient, comparing to
complicated processes of damage compensation and financial crime evidence confirmation
search. Mastercard, for example, was able to reduce attacks on customer accounts by
80%.

</p><!--l. 185--><p class="indent" >     Numerous Financial Instituations are leveraging AI-driven chatbots and algorithms to
support existing customer service channels with faster, more consistent intelligence. One of the
common thoughts on AI application in Front office are Biometrics. Biometrics are widely
represented by various recognition systems for much safer authentication. Voice recognition is
used to determine client by voice, facial recognition technologies, which are based on ML
and AI, help to determine a client or to check correctness of client’s photo data.
Similarly, Computer Vision technologies allows to determine the authenticity of physical

systems.
</p><!--l. 192--><p class="indent" >     As a minor use case, Front Office is interested in offering Personalized financial products,

</p><!--l. 197--><p class="indent" >     This is an alternative to communication with financial consultants in order to create and

</p><!--l. 202--><p class="indent" >     It is believed, that those systems can create accurate forecasts for stock market
environment, due to possibilities of automatic collection and analysis of the state of foreign
exchange markets and latest economic news. This allows client to invest into tools with the
lowest risk.
</p><!--l. 206--><p class="indent" >     Robo-advising became a powerful alternative to financial consultants in basic questions,
related to banking, financial management and cash transactions. The portfolio in the US
financial markets, which is now being managed by robots, have already reached $1 trillion in
2020 and rapidly increases, expecting to make up its volume up to $2.85 trillion in
2025.
</p><!--l. 211--><p class="indent" >     Going further, AI can be widely used not only for helping clients with investments, but in
entire Individual Banking. Standardized financial products and services for wide range of
consumers cannot satisfy needs of modern client. Modern clients require personified conditions
for accounts, loans and other services. Without individual approach it is impossible
to implement, therefore, one would need Artificial Intelligence as well. Nowadays,
every financial entity develops and offers between 10 and 20 financial products. For
developing such products banks need a team of professionals. Developing hundreds of
thousands of personified offers for every bank client is, by fact, impossible without help of
Artificial Intelligence. According to statistics, nearly every person has between 2 and 5
electronic devices, which can connect to internet, use various messengers or social
networks.
</p><!--l. 220--><p class="indent" >     Naturally, every internet user leaves enormous volume of data after himself. Analyzing
that personified data effectively allows creating various unique personified advices and offers.
Algorithms of Artificial Intelligence, theoretically, can collect client information, analyze and
generate individual personified offer.
</p><!--l. 224--><p class="indent" >     As a result, whole service industry becomes more and more personal. Screening social
networks profiles, collecting GPS or any other position data allows classifying client and to
create his social portrait. Obviously, from bank’s side, it allows to effectively determine credit
rating for every client. At the same time, as an example, if one works in an agricultural field,
bank can suggest and recommend various products connected with harvest insurance. As for
small business, analyzing supply chain and contragents of that business, bank can at the
same time analyze seasonality of payments and more accurately predict time ranges,
during which client liquidity can drastically decrease, or possible cash gaps. This
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
knowledge allows bank to operate more effectively and saves business from a useless
hassle.
</p><!--l. 231--><p class="indent" >     At the same time, case of Conversation Banking is extensively developing and has to be
precisely analyzed. Conversation Banking for the last 3 years became extremely popular.
Among the largest U.S. and international banks, the greatest focus today is on conversational
interfaces, such as chatbots and virtual assistants.
</p><!--l. 236--><p class="indent" >     The main purpose of Conversation Banking is a client communication. Nowadays, there
are general purpose AI programs, that are able to speak to people. Having a chat-bot
call assistant for common problems allows bank to extend it into artificial personal
assistant, including financial one, that can help a bank client using his and only his
data.
</p><!--l. 241--><p class="indent" >     Chatbots are one of the most effective ways to answer questions from employees and
customers. Client can call to a bank and talk about his problem, but due to the fact, that this
problem can be categorized, a client can talk to bot, that can help client to solve his problem
and tell about some problem related services. Moreover, it can analyze client needs and
immediately provide various financial recommendations. Of course, that can be presented with
any form of communication, both with SMS, internet messages or voice messages and
calls.
</p><!--l. 246--><p class="indent" >     But there is even more interesting point of view. Based on the various researches, banks
that are targeting teens and younger adults has to take to its concern, that younger people are
not used to talk over phone, but to contact via messengers. Therefore, banks have to
develop text chat-bots, and on various platforms, including bank’s website, bank’s
mobile application, and chat-bots for application, where those people prefer to use, like
Facebook.
</p><!--l. 251--><p class="indent" >     In addition to chat-bots, banks can use voice assistants. According to him, the assistant
will help users in solving financial and everyday tasks — money transfer or reserving a table in a
restaurant.
</p><!--l. 254--><p class="indent" >     For example, Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant are tightly coupled into
everyday life of modern people and access to such fields of can result in an extremely
high level of interaction between bank and client, and, therefore, increases client’s
loyalty.
</p><!--l. 256--><p class="indent" >     Bank’s client can ask in this case various general questions and receive answers
immediately. For example, client can ask what payments were done with debit card last week,
level of debt of a credit card and when fixed-term deposit ends. As a result, client
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
doesn’t spend time looking for information on bank’s webpage, sorting history in
mobile or web app. The assistant has another area of usage as well. For example, using
an installed app, that is able to recognize products on store shelves, assistant can
display cashback amount, which would be returned to the client after paying by credit
card.
</p><!--l. 263--><p class="indent" >     As a result, client communication is expected to outlive vitaly crucial challenges. Firstly,
there is a growing competition over clients, both in attraction of new and in retention of old
ones. Secondly, ready-made technologies may allow to execute this much more effectively and
with lower costs, then an operator. Basically, almost all banks replace communication employees
with a program — the chat-bot. Usually this transformation is being done painlessly for a bank,
as in most cases a foundation already exists. In recent years operators were building client
communication based on a script, scenario of a dialog. In case of more complicated talk,
operator have to transfer a talk to a manager with more responsibilities. Based on
research, modern chatting solutions can not be distinguished from an alive person by
60% clients. Chat-bots are attractive for business by providing consistent access to
bank information with an immediate feedback, which is extremely important for the
client.
</p><!--l. 273--><p class="indent" >     Response delayed by 5 minutes decreases chances to create long-term bonds with a client
by 10 times, resulting in building bonds with a bank, that answered the call, as in this case
client feel himself important. Nevertheless, it is still important to leave a possibility to contact
an alive employee, as 79% of respondents would positively react on a conversation with a
human, while 74% negatively react, if they would have a conversation with a machine, without
a possibility to have a contact with a human. However, modern programs may transfer
communication to an employee, who has much more possibilities to handle a non-typical talk.
Client is important for a bank in case if he is using bank services on a regular basis, and
constant contact is a reason of 70% of purchases of banking services. Chatbot, as a universal
worker without breaks and competitors, especially for big banks with large client
base, which bank has to be in a constant contact with. Nowadays, such robots to a
large extent are replacing call centers, mailing centers and in certain cases marketing
divisions.
</p><!--l. 281--><p class="indent" >     Swiss bank UBS, which is in Top 50 by assets, developed service Ask UBS to serve
companies which specialize over managing client finance. Offered service allows receiving advices
in wide range of questions and financial markets analysis. Moreover, it works as an educational
service, clarifying definitions, giving definitions to acronyms and translating professional slang
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
of the financial market. According to UBS representative, bank intends to turn Ask UBS
into a common instrument, which could be “secure, compliant, and trustable for
clients.
</p><!--l. 287--><p class="indent" >     Correctly developed program may not just execute multiple routine functions, but have an
ability for self-education and self-correction. Some specialists assume this would not be any
burdensome development, if software developers didn’t receive overcomplicated requirements.
However, extremely complicated solutions supporting multiple platforms and self-learning
may be pretty expensive. Therefore, most banks start exploring the digital world of
chat solutions with simple virtual agents, which is mostly based on scripting and
scenarios.
</p><!--l. 292--><p class="indent" >     Another important direction of client communication improvement is the personalization
of products and services. Personalization is one of the main, if not the main, instruments for
competition in banking sector. Previous criteria of competitiveness, as price of banking
products, service delivery rate and accessibility, are fading out in significant extent, especially
due to the fact of equalizing of competitors due to equivalent access to modern technologies,
leaving no place for tangible superiority.
</p><!--l. 296--><p class="indent" >     Competition over bank client moves towards digital solutions with the priority to develop
client adapted, demand-based product, to form convincing recommendations, up to ready-made
solutions, based on client needs, thoughts and expectations. Banks obtain possibility to
influence actively on client behavior by using large amounts of data. By processing that data,
artificial intelligence receive an option to offer client personified product on best suitable user
conditions, as it, obviously, considers client’s targets and financial possibilities. It is common for
such products to get ahead of client wishes, resulting in forming request by consulting and
clarification.
</p><!--l. 302--><p class="indent" >     Santander bank even instituted an award for developing a program, which would allow
joining banking products with client needs.  In this part of banking the importance of
consultants and intermediaries in relationships between banks and clients is increasing.
</p><!--l. 306--><p class="indent" >     Naturally, conditions of digital economics allow for a robot to be the consultant, which
would make recommendations about better products, institutions and services oriented on
specific client. This results in a trend of separating it into independent activities without
binding to a single financial company.
</p><!--l. 309--><p class="indent" >     Possible options of activity for general purpose solutions are much wider, as such solutions
are not only based on bank products and services, but those can offer interaction with
companies with more favorable conditions. High level of personification of service and demand
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
for intermediate service providers may even lead to the extintion of traditional forms of product
offering, which is currently based on each product separately, for example, debit cards, payment
systems, loans and saving accounts. Instead of traditional offering, digitalization allows for
development of universal financial service, which would implement all financial client
requirements in a single integrated service, and what is more important, in way which would fit
client needs the most. One more step towards banking automatization is remote customer
service for a certain range of operations. Such possibility can be offered by a solution,
identifying client by specific features — facial features, voice features or finger capillary
network.
</p><!--l. 315--><p class="indent" >     There are even more exotic options. For example, one Japanese researcher suggest using
individual person’s blinking behavior. British bank Halifax conducts test of a special bracelet,
which would register individual heartbeat features.
</p><!--l. 320--><p class="indent" >     Some of those technologies have already been tested in production for financial operation.
Most known example is the Apple Pay on iPhones, which uses facial recognition not only for
phone unlocking, but also for executing operations via Apple Pay and other digital wallets.
Specialists claim that ways of person identification are becoming more complicated. On the
other hand, those technologies at the same time become much more reliable and stop being
exotic.
</p><!--l. 324--><p class="indent" >     Google Intelligence predicts that by 2021 1.9 billion of bank clients would use biometric
data for remote services. However, there is still no large demand by banks for such remote forms
of service, even though those technologies of identification have been developed long time ago
and even tested by bank security services. This is mainly due to lack of guarantee for operation
to be voluntary, without any unlawful influence and there is no satisfying solution for such
problem yet.
</p><!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >     Artificial Intelligence has already become a leading driver for technology innovations in
banking sector. It has already been developed enough and definitely reliable in everything
regarding risks, confidentiality, human factor and marketing strategies.
</p><!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >     Nevertheless, AI has already changed financial business and will change it even more in
near future. The vast majority of actions, that are being done both in back-office, middle-office
and front-office by employees can be automized and algorithmized.

<!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >     The main interest for banks is in application of AI in front-office and middle-office, as it
will lead to significant cost reduction, up to $400 billion in 2025. Banks use AI in front-office for
identification and authentication of clients, in order to imitiate alive workers with chat-bots and
voice assistants, to deepen relationships with customer, increase engagement, and to offer
personalized ideas and recommendations. Additionally, AI is being used in middle-office. It
allows detecting and preventing frauds with payments, upgrading processes connected to
anti-money laundering processes and detection for know your customer control systems. Those
sources of income, which have already been transformed by AI, show the valid way to use this
possibility. Nevertheless, those strategies show that banks have to create holistic strategy, which
would connect and cover multiple scopes of banking, sources of useful data, third-parties and
employees.
</p><!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >     However, with all the advantages of modern software, forecasts of full robotization
probably won’t be realized, as in near future it is unlikely for a program to replace a
person.
</p><!--l. 77--><p class="indent" >     In order to integrate the foregoing into existing banking service it is necessary for banking
platform to support it. Obviously, those platforms, which current banking stands on were
developed around 15-30 years ago, or even more, and this makes integration of modern
algorithms almost impossible. This is why modern banks are now puzzled if it is possible to
reengineer their software in order to have an effective possibility to embed Artificial Intelligence
and Machine Learning in its banking platform.
</p><!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >     Nevertheless, it is extremely important to remember, that automating workplaces doesn’t
always lead to dismissal of workers. It is important to create retraining programs, that would
allow existing employees to obtain new skills in fields, that are out of risk of automation, in
order to decrease automation’s influence on labour market.
</p><!--l. 85--><p class="indent" >     Increasing number of internet users, availability of smartphones and other handheld
devices, and rapid development of mobile internet forms new users’ habits and behaviors. Social
network users and mobile app users are more and more focused on getting instant results and
target specific actions with the lowest amount of clicks possible.
</p><!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >     However, the need of receiving high-quality financial services and personal consultations
hasn’t disappeared: people are still calling to call-centers. Even though remote banking
service systems are rapidly developing, number of phone calls recently significantly
increased.
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
</p><!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >     Nevertheless, there are good news for banks that have yet to embark on their AI journey.
Making progress in AI does not require an unbearable effort. It typically begins with identifying
your organizational goals, readying your data and finding the right partners. Nonetheless, even
medium-sized and small banks have to investigate this topic by now, as in future, gap between
AI users and nonuser will only widen.

<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >     Conversational banking is a revolution in bank interaction with clients. This term is
comparably new and represents an approach in the bank interaction of banks with their
customers in their natural language through a dialogue interface or special widgets, which
makes dialog more comfortable.
</p><!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >     People change their behavior and habits in favor of dialog interfaces, as they wait
fast and qualified answers. One specialist sometimes may not promptly respond to
a client request and needs a pause, in order to either find and answer or transfer
request to a more experienced specialist. In this case client has to wait, sometimes
for a long time, which can create irritation and, respectively, decrease the level of
satisfaction.
</p><!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >     One of the leaders of market of professional services in digital technologies, Accenture, in
its researches found out that existing online interaction channels are gradually becoming
obsolete. Therefore, banks have to use a brand-new way, by establishing a continuous
conversation, in order to eliminate the flaws of models used on a current stage of
banking technologies development. Digital platforms are extremelly important for
banks.

Language Generation, NLG, which structures, plans and generates human-readable text.

<!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >     It is important to highlight the exponential grow and compliction of those models. NLP
models can have multiple billions of parameters and coefficients, that those use for text
analysis and generation, with a current record of 175 billion parameters by famous
GPT-3.
</p><!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >     Main purpose of NLP with AI in this case is to replace usual contact centers and to
improve customer experience. The reason of replacement is a comparingly low conversion for
existing solutions. Contact centers are infamous for response times and low quality of solutions.
This is extremelly important, as consumers have low conversion rates if brands don’t answer
phone in under a minute. Based on researches, 78% of responsers may switch brand preferences
due to poor response times, while 73% will recommend highly responsive brands.
Additionally, 59% of responders have extremelly high conversion rate for highly responsive
brands.
</p><!--l. 77--><p class="indent" >     At the same time, achieving positive feedback in under a minute is a main target of
automated conversational banking. Chat-bots are known for giving high conversion rates and
large returns on considerable small inverstments.
</p><!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >     In consequence, banks can strive to major influence of dialog interfaces on client, through
which clients can transfer funds, send it to other clients, issue card, convert currency, execute
payments and various other basic tasks.
</p><!--l. 83--><p class="indent" >     It is common to mix up Conversational banking with Mobile and Internet Banking.
However, the main difference is in user experience. Mobile and Internet banking are hierarchical
trees, both of those have a concrete form. It is always an application, in which user can
click buttons, check charts and read text in order to manipulate and make actions.
Conversational banking is much more abstract. That is a dialog, client should not in this case
know the structure of interaction. In order to achieve something client has to have
an intent and, what is even more important, to invoke an action by intention. He
doesn’t need to know how to achieve something, he can just ask. However, in this case
client can rely only on his knowledge, as there would be no buttons or menus to
check.
</p><!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >     Front-office for Conversational banking may have different forms. This can be a contact
center, retail business unit for dialog-based conversation. Couple of years ago, bank client on
any problem had to call to a contact center and to talk to customer service line manager.
Nowadays, there are other options. Much more interesting option is a messenger, as a
front-office for textual interactions. In this case, this can be both a chat-bot in a popular
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
messenger app or a social network, same chat-bot in a mobile or internet banking app, or even a
voice assistant.
</p><!--l. 101--><p class="indent" >     Currently, it is a popular solution to use chat-bots which can answer to the most simple
question, but mostly transfer a conversation to the contact center. Though, this is a not a most
effective model, as client firstly has to spend his time to describe his problem to a chat-bot, and
then he has to repeat to a human specialist.

<!--l. 143--><p class="indent" >     However, for customer it is still more comfortable to address problems via common
channels of interactions, such as via phone calls or via in-person conversation in a
branch.
</p><!--l. 146--><p class="indent" >     This is due too negative experience with current automated conversational solutions.
It is too early to talk about conversational banking in a poor form, as chat-bots
are on such level of development, that those cannot be used purely, as they don’t
understand all the requests yet. This results in a negative influence towards client
satisfaction.
</p><!--l. 150--><p class="indent" >     On the other side, it is important to discuss approaches to build this system.
During client conversation it is important to transfer from screen interface of mobile or
internet-bank to creation of universal and operational assistant, which would be ready to
interact and to help a client at any time. This form of client interaction is based on an
understanding of a global trend, as more and more people are used to talk with sellers via
messengers. Even though automated solutions are not common, those, nearly 44% of
customers would prefer to speak to chatbot, if they are sure, that a chat-bot knows an
answer.  Therefore, implementing any automatized conversational interface for a bank is
impossible without influencing expectations. This transforms entire service consumption
process, as it is more comfortable to contact via suitable and familiar solutions and
messengers.
</p><!--l. 158--><p class="indent" >     Conversational banking has some significant advantages in comparison to existing systems.
Firstly, improvement of client experience. We can make it more comfortable, fast and qualified.
Secondly, conversational banking decreases client waiting time. If chat-bot is not sure about the
question or the answer, dialog can be transferred to a human operator. In case if system
achieves certain level of assurance — it will reply automatically. Researches of client experience
had shown that verbal interaction is psychologically more comfortable and brings less cognitive
load than visual interface.
</p><!--l. 167--><p class="indent" >     From a practical perspective, conversational banking exists in two pure forms. First form
is a chat-bot, an automatic solution for textual communication with a client in a form of a
dialog window. The input in this case is a text provided by a user, and the output is a text
returned by an analytical system, which consumes request and generates response. Second form
is a voice assistant. Internal work is analogical to a chat-bot, but it differs in a form of
interaction. Voice assistant receives spoken user messages and answers with synthesized voice
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
responses. Both of those forms are well known to users. However, in most cases those are
usually used as a support part and do not have sufficient level of autonomy. Application of
AI to those well known forms of interaction is the main purpose of Conversational
Banking.
</p><!--l. 176--><p class="indent" >     Consumers are used to chat and for them, it is easier than to click out their problem in an
interface of website or mobile app. The process of automation in banks is gradually growing and
this, from the one side, should lead to a reduction of a number of contact center specialists. On
the other side, increasing number of customers consequently increases chat loads. Nevertheless,
increasing load shows higher client involvement.
</p><!--l. 181--><p class="indent" >     Nonetheless, current state of AI application in Front-office has certain problems.
As it was mentioned before in <a 
href="#x1-4011r5">2.2.5.<!--tex4ht:ref: subsec:ai_front_office --></a>, conversational banking is not considered as
available by middle-sized and small banks. Mostly it is used either by the largest
commercial banks, which have large amounts of resources available for investments,
or by start-ups and new digital financial services, which are targeting market by
innovations.
</p><!--l. 185--><p class="indent" >     As a result, banks face a choice — use existing solutions or to create their own product,
which is not available to small-sized and medium banks. However, it is not entirely correct, as
medium-sized and small banks can and have to use third-party solutions for implementation.
On the other hand, integration of external technologies uses very large volume of bank
resources, as well as cost of product usage. As a result, final cost may be higher than cost of
internal development.
</p><!--l. 190--><p class="indent" >     Another major problem is obvious and connected to existing employees in customer
experience offices. As cost decrease on customer support being a valid reason for banks, this
doesn’t mean that banks will decrease amount of support agents. In contrast, those may be
moved to other branches or to other banking products. Additionally, support agents may
require training for changing their profile. The point of this action is not to decrease a
number of employees, but to create a higher percentage of professionals among existing
specialists.

</p><!--l. 200--><p class="indent" >     Nevertheless, the largest banks already have solutions for dialog interfaces in messengers.
In those case, they are developing solutions for artificially augmented intellegence in client
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
support. It is a common misconception, that those chat-bots are for customers only. Indeed,
those are much more useful for bank employees as a single source of knowledge and can
significantly improve client experience. It is too early to talk about conversational banking in a
poor form.
</p><!--l. 206--><p class="indent" >     On other side, it is important to discuss approaches to build this system. During client

experience had shown that verbal interaction is psychologically more comfortable and brings
less cognitive load than visual interface. Even the best market players warn — system should
provide connection with a human, as there is no technology, that would allow delegating
functions to computers entirely.
</p><!--l. 220--><p class="indent" >     As well, chat-bot can answer by itself directly. Unfortunately, currently it concerns only
the most simple actions — customer welcoming, customer invitation, various forms of apologize,
or informing the location of the nearest ATM. If there is a large stream of clients, we can lower
the system confidence threshold, in order to transfer clients to chat-bot, which could decrease
waiting time and, as a result, increase client’s service satisfaction. Moreover, it is possible to
involve one robot into dialogue with another robot. For example, general support chat-bot can
involve investment chat-bot.

last decade was done by Apple and its voice assistant Siri in 2010. It would be impossible to
create such solution without Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning technologies.
However, the main reason was due to full control of operational system they were able to build
a market.
</p><!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >     The second wave of AI popularity was due in 2016, when Facebook made a bot platform,
which allowed to create AI-powered bots inside social network. This showed practical
importance of such technologies and was a main driving force of further practical applicaton on
AI in front-offices in various industries. As a result, apart from being the biggest social
network, with 3 billion monthly active users , and an important channel of customer
communication, Facebook obtained a massive influence on chatbot market and is one of the
main catalyst of growth of this market. Moreover, Facebook invested significant funds
into development of speech technologies, creating both toolkits for developers and
developing and new sells channels, which made AI chatbots with NLP even more
accessible.
</p><!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >     Starting from 2017 banks, various financial and insurance companies started showing

2024.
</p><!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >     Even though by the end of 2021 the quality of chatbot implementations was on a pretty
low level, its popularity is growing rapidly. On the other hand, the positive effect will be
brought by massive consumption of services of devices with NLU support, for example, smart
speakers, or voice interfaces for mobile applications. This leads to popularization of voice
control, due to its expluatation convenience and possible automation of routine processes, as
those speakers usually can work as a voice controlled assistant. Henceforth, by 2025
existence of talking chat-bots, de-facto, will become the norm for most of the internet
services.
</p><!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >     Chatbot technology is quite in demand by marketing departments of various companies
for quick contact with potential customers, as well as online customer support organizations.
Chatbots act as a customer manager services or as a support specialist. Company, which uses
this technology, can obtain both an advantage, for example, reduced staff costs, and a
disadvantage — outflow of clients who do not want to conduct a dialogue with the &#x0022;computer&#x0022;.
Consequently, chat-bot technology allows optimizing business-processes and find out reasonable
compromise in simplifying client interaction with bankers with simultaneous increase of level of
service and cost reducement on call-centers and SMS notification services. Dialog
imitation should occur in a familiar and comfortable for client environment, and
at the same time client should receive choice of services which previously wasn’t
available via website or remote business service systems, so it could store and raise client
loyalty.
</p><!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >     Unfortunately, text recognition and natural language processing are an avant-garde
frontier of Artificial Intelligence, and it still has to be brought up to an acceptable level.
Popularity of promising, according to multiple companies, of so-called interface bots,
that are based on Social Network platforms, for example, Facebook, do not provide
high-quality imitation of live conversation and do not maintain customer loyalty. Those
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
conversational bots are usually being criticized, especially its more primitive analogues, as
they still have limitations to have a mindful dialog. Discussing issues clients are still
in need of sense of live content and due to this the most promising direction is the
development of conversational chat-bots, but only given that there are wide possibilities
of language processing and analysis. It would be extremely hard, but still possible
to create a true chat-bot, that would be able to imitate human speech with high
quality.
</p><!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >     This solution will significantly decrease load on a call-center and keep the possibility of
live dialogue in specific corner cases. Additionally, this technology allows to create a specific
subtype of chatbots, although it is more common, as it is being developed and supported by
major companies of IT market — personal assistants. Hundreds millions of people are
interacting with personal digital assistants on such platforms as Google, Apple, Amazon,
Facebook and others. Digital Assistants are a specific subtype of chatbots, although it is

voice communication with user makes the transition from Graphical User Interface
towards Conversational User Interface, which can be the key trend for the coming
years.
</p><!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >     Textual and voice communication with user makes the transition from Graphical User
Interface towards Conversational User Interface, which can be the key trend for the coming
years. Many messenger apps, for example, Facebook Messenger, have public APIs —
programming interface, which allows creating chatbots. Companies can use those apps as
intermediaries in order to increase performance of its employees.
</p><!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >     Additionally, those can be a new channel for client service, either via corporate website, or
by some new service channel. Uber allows to order a car via Facebook Messenger. But
extremelly important is the launch of Amazon Alexa, that can be used by third-party
companies for customer communication, as well as integrated into different user devices, like
smartphones, smart speakers and any other devices with sound input, sound output and
internet connection.
</p><!--l. 77--><p class="indent" >     Nevertheless, chatbots are not just a simple frontend. Firstly, banks can use same chatbot
communication channel for notifications to increase level of client engagement. In general, live
chat can be used as a direct client communication channel with clients. Information on product
specs and services, contact info, payments proceeding, financial recommendations.
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
Secondly, large amount of client data allows making targetized, individual decisions and
solutions. This is a strong strategical advantage, as correct account information would
allow more precisely offer personal recommendations. Moreover, large amount of
client data allows making more targeted decisions without using exclusively strategic
approach. Account information and its nature allows more correctly approach personal
offers.
</p><!--l. 86--><p class="indent" >     Chat-bot is not an end in itself, but an instrument for checking and testing. The only
practical sense in chatbots are in costs reduction, not in profit generation. On the other hand,
high growth rates of chatbot market with NLP technologies is due to early stage of its
formation.
</p><!--l. 90--><p class="indent" >     Among the main problems, hindering the use of this technology, the main problem is poor
user awareness of functionality, quality and convenience of services. However, developers are
trying to eliminate those disadvantages by launching various interactive features. Despite having
the greatest prospects in reducing costs for call centers and other support services, this
technology has a great advantage in direct customer services. Digital assistants would be able to
make catalog navigation easier catalogs and offer users desired products. Since local business is
aggressively integrating Artificial Intelligence, future increasing costs of development of chatbots
is just a matter of time, as it would significantly decrease costs on customer service
services.
</p><!--l. 97--><p class="indent" >     Significant change is expected in Asia-Pacific region due to large amount of people and
historically smartphone-oriented digital market. Scientists of Temple University and Fudan
University conducted a study among 6000 clients of financial service company. All clients were
talking either to chatbots or real people without expirience in sales. Disclosure of the “identity”
of the interlocutor was carried out at the beginning of the conversation or at the end,
after the purchase. Moreover, in several groups the “identity” was not disclosed. AI
turned out to be 4 times more effective than an ordinary unexperienced employee.
However, if client founds out the company uses a chatbot before buying, the sale
chance drop by more than 79.7%. According to researchers, these results shouldn’t
restrain usage of chatbots. AI has undeniable technological advantages, which allow
reducing prices by reducing the cost of manual labor. In addition, marketers would
have to take this research into account and increase customer confidence in chat
robots.
</p><!--l. 109--><p class="indent" >     The main feature is that chat-bots require same decision-making system as any other
frontend, and is dependent of every single client. This, in its turn, receives the biggest profit
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
from PSD2 and Open Banking Initiative.
</p><!--l. 114--><p class="indent" >     In order to implement such an automated conversational solution banks can either develop
their own solutions from the very roots, use existing available instruments for individual custom
solutions, or to apply available third-party options offered by specialized companies. Current
stage of ML technologies allows for companies to access NLP with considerably low costs for
own implementation. Modern programming technologies have various technologies and
programming libraries for creation of NLP systems and many companies for advanced support.
Among most promising open-source solutions are DeepPavlov.ai and Rasa. Those
allow creation of own Natural Language Processing systems based on community
support.
</p><!--l. 120--><p class="indent" >     On the other hand, there are a lot of NLP start-ups, that focus on AI chatbots of various
complexity. Among those are LiveChat, Kore.ai with BankAssist, Kasisto, Morph.ai,
Imperson.ai, Streebo, Creative Virtual and Artificial Solutions.
</p><!--l. 123--><p class="indent" >     What is even more important, large IT corporations have their own solutions,
resulting in easier form of integration with existing infrastructure. Among those are IBM
Watson, Google Dialogflow, Amazon Lex, SAP Recast.ai, Baidu KITT.ai, Facebook
Messenger Platform. The leader of those is currently Microsoft, which has Azure Bot
Service, Semantic Machines and LUIS, Microsoft Language Understanding Intelligent
Service. Proper analyzes of possibilities require proper classification of chatbots by
features.

website or mobile application for proper interaction. Secondly, chatbot can be based
on a third-party messenger, such as Facebook Messenger. Thirdly, chatbot can be
integrated with an operating system assistant. For example, with Apple Siri on iOS

Frontend defines user interface, a form of a user interaction both textual and by voice.
Middleware is a rule-based or Machine Learning based decoder and parser, which receives an
input from frontend, produces commands with input arguments, passes to backend, and
generates text or voice message based on backend response. Backend, accordingly, executes
commands with input arguments and produces output, based on an internal banking logic.
As it is possible to observe, from functional aspect it is not import either this is a
textual chat-bot or is invoked by voice. Those differ only by the frontend for the
user. In both solutions we have to use Natural Language Programming technologies
to either transform text or speech into commands valid for backend API. Such an
architecture allows building conversational solutions in a form of simple, on interface level,
blocks.

<!--l. 236--><p class="indent" >     Overwhelmingly, as a frontend, chatbots use textual dialog messenger and usually are
associated with this form. In this use-case customer write via suitable messenger, social network
or application in an extremelly familiar environment. Obviously, familiarity is also connected to
prior existance of customer support dialogs in any form. Nonetheless, as it was mentioned
before, this is only a form of interaction, not a logic by itself and not the most labor-intensive
part of the chatbot.

<tspan font-family="ec-lmbx" font-size="12">3.2.3.</tspan><tspan font-family="ec-lmbx" font-size="12">    Middleware</tspan>
</p><!--l. 244--><p class="indent" >     Input received from frontend is passed to middleware. Middleware can be either on a bank
side, or on some third-party service. Middleware is required for preprocesing of an input for
processing on a bank side, or for postprocessing of an output received from a bank side for
proper customer understanding. In other words, this is a part of logic not connected
to banking operations, but is required for proper understanding on both sides of
interaction.
</p><!--l. 249--><p class="indent" >     The most simple case is for Rule-based decision-making. For this option there is no need
to use complicated Statistics and Machine Learning knowledge, but input is represented by
limited set of options and output is presented as a filled template answer. This case is preferred
for faster chat-bot development, or for a chat-bot on an employee side, which is hidden from a
client.
</p><!--l. 253--><p class="indent" >     Nevertheless, middleware can have a much more complicated form. Ideally, this is the first
frontier of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technics in chatbots However, it is not
used for analytics, but mainly for Natural Language Processing.
</p><!--l. 257--><p class="indent" >     Natural Language Processing, NLP, divides in two parts — Natural Language
Understanding and Natural Language Generation. Natural Language Understanding is a branch
of NLP which uses Artificial Intelligence, mostly Machine Learning technics, for building
software to understand input in the form of sentences using text or speech. Natural
Language Generation is a branch of NLP which uses Artificial Intelligence, mostly
Machine Learning technics, for building software to generate text and synthesize
tet.
</p><!--l. 261--><p class="indent" >     Accordingly, Conversational Banking has to be created with two instruments, Natural
Language Understanding for input and Natural Language Generation for output. Moreover,
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
same middleware can be used for various forms, as a text or speech understanding framework
for call-center bots, website chatbots or roboadvisers and for text or speech generation for SMS,
text answers or cold calling.

</p><!--l. 267--><p class="indent" >     Backend part of any conversational interaction is the most important from a banking side,
as it is directly connected to banking processes. This part is actual part of execution of
transactions, request or for other orders of operations, including current balance check.
Moreover, it is inextricably linked with actual bank as a platform for financial services. In
comparison to frontend, interface for bank interaction has to be strictly formulated and
defined, as, basically, this represents API, application programming interface, of a
bank.
</p><!--l. 272--><p class="indent" >     The most intense usage of AI is possible here and can be shared with all levels of
banking. The root source of data for decision-making based on AI is a metadata
collected from requests. As those request interface is strictly formulated, it is possible
to define which type of data to collect, obviously, confirmed to GDPR regulations
and requirements, and after proper anonymizing of corresponding data. Backend
of a chatbot should be connected to general recommendation system of a bank, as
conversational banking, from a bank perspective, is yet another channel for client interaction.
Obviously, mentioned recommendation system is a main source of Machine Learning
based decision-making, as it can build unpredictable models of client behaviour, both
individual and as a group, and based on those models observe future client trends, give
recommendations and what is even more important, contact with a client based on a made
decision.
</p><!--l. 278--><p class="indent" >     Secondly, this is a place for AI to learn customer related questions not connected to
bank services, but to regulations. For example, using supervised learning AI can
learn, based on previous answers by a contact center, what documents client need
to open current account or be informed about entire process of opening brokerage
account.

</p><!--l. 284--><p class="indent" >     Chatbots are an extremelly form of client interaction. Even though latest achievements of
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
Artificial Intelligence can and has to be applied to banking, those can be comparingly
independent and developed separately and parallelly by different parties. Moreover, those
parts can be connected to existing banking services and interfaces and don’t require
changes other, than those required by modern banking regulations or Open Banking
philosophy. Banks can use same chatbot communication channel for notifications to
increase level of client engagement. In general, live chat can be used as a direct client
communication channel with clients, provide information on product specs and services, contact
info, payments proceeding, financial recommendations and many other goods and
services.
</p><!--l. 290--><p class="indent" >     It is possible to highlight several trends, which may have the most significant impact on
the development of the chatbot industry in the near future. Firstly, growth of share of combined
solutions, in which robots are not able to replace human completely, but complement for
repeating routine activities. The most promising among of them are assistants for human
operators, that are integrated with Robotic Process Automation. The second trend is the
development of tools for business intelligence data mining and building ontologies for
unstructured data. In other words, those are the systems into which it is possible to upload a
variety of texts, and it will automatically extract semantic connections and build language
models, specific for that certain domain. Lastly, shareable knowledge between different chatbots
and chatbot platforms. That would allow creating personified virtual assistants, with the special
“personality” for each client. As a result, we can say that Artificial Intelligence and
Machine Learning mostly are being used by Front Office in a hidden for an ordinary
man.

<tspan font-family="ec-lmbx" font-size="12">Introduction</tspan>
</p><!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >     Developing a chat-bot for a financial institution is expected to bring high costs and
consume lots of time. However, consequent approach to chat-bot development will lead to
iterative process and precise control over development of new form of client interaction. Existing
market situation already requires certain mechanism, that are required for Conversational
Banking. In Europe PSD2 made a major influence by forcing banks to make public APIs for
payments and accounts. Even though it required a lot of work, things done may become a
foundation for a global Bank-as-a-Service wave of popularity. Besides, iterative approach
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
with proper strategy would lead to adaptation to current trends and forecast future
trends.

</p><!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >     Nowadays, Open Banking is one of the most important innovations in banking.
Moreover, the latest requirements of Bank Regulators all over the world demand this
innovation. Thus, granting access to more banking activities and services is an obvious
trend.
</p><!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >     Currently, PSD2 demand only a small subset of operation, initiation of payments and
account check. However, this had already forced banks to know how to make secured public
APIs according to regulations. As a set of possible operation using third-party providers is
limited, we can assure that there are two APIs, for internal usage and for public
usage.

<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >     Accordingly, internal bank API is used for official bank’s internet banking web application
or mobile banking application. Obviously, same internal API can be used for internal usage
among internal bank services. More or less, mentioned graph represents current state of banking

</p><!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >     In ideal world it would be easy and comfortable for banks to make entire API public and
supportable. This would allow banks to focus on financial operations and stability, instead of
front-offices. Unfortunately, this is not possible due to tactical reasons and obvious risks for
such major changes. Nevertheless, we can assume that certain forms of financial services can be
used via public API.
</p><!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >     API is a programming interface from a set of ready-made functions or structures that are
provided by an application or service. This API has to support as many banking services,
as possible, both for registered, bank, users and newcomers. Among those services
could be, among PSD2-based balance check and setting payments, as listing public or
individual offers, loan requirements check, deposit terms, additional services and legal
information.
</p><!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >     As a second step, banks have to make mentioned API public or licensible. Basically, this
would allow for bank to work in a Bank-as-a-Service business model in a more abstract way.
The reasoning behind this is in high costs of internal solutions. Additionally, bank
may not be interested or cannot allow for itself to invest into risky forms of client
interaction. Bank-as-a-Service model for third-party FinTechs is an applyable option in this
case, as it would allow transfering customer interaction risks to FinTechs. This is the
very first step where AI is useble in any form. Basically, this step represents risk
deduction by allowing FinTech using Bank-as-a-Service. How to create client interaction,
how to analyze client interaction and how to interpret results becomes a problem for
third-parties.
</p><!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >     In this case, bank can check and validate strategies done by third-parties for client
interaction, and in case of positive impact bank can decide what is more applyable — either to
continue serving as a service bank, or to create new ways of client interaction by
itself.

focus on B2C cooperation and find clients more precisely and in more effective way,
especially by uniting services of multiple Banks-as-a-Services. Mentioned operations would
inevitably result in risky, state-of-art FinTech start-ups. As a result, Conversational

precise analysis and planning. Firstly, a user-input message has to pass data cleansing and go to
NLU engine, which transforms a message into contextual keywords, which would allow dialog
manager to handle. More simple forms, which can be templated or is a common knowledge, for
example, currency rates, can be received via database of questions and answers. More
complicated logic has to be handled in Dialog Manager. As a result, formed response passes
to NLG engine, which generates text or synthesizes speech, which is passed as an
output to user. Obviously, for development reasons dialog has to be collected and
analyzed with metadata. Accordingly, Artificial Intelligence is a main logical solution for
Natural Language Understanding, Natural Language Generation, Dialog Manager and

important, in case of having sufficient budget, this solution can be done in parallel with API
extension and UI of front-office development. Therefore, time to market for middleware highly
depends on chosen strategy and available budget.

<!--l. 418--><p class="indent" >     Next logical step would be creation of Machine Learning based middleware. This step is
the most intense and the most expensive stage. Additionally, this stage cannot be done
parallely with other stages, as it requires enormous investments and development
involvement, which adversely affect time consumption. However, it is not the only negative
affect, as this stage additionally requires using supervised Machine Learning, which
requires sequential time-consuming stages, as data collection, teaching process and
model testing. Nevertheless, time to market is even longer if this middleware has to be
used for customer related chat-bot, as, firstly, it has to be used by employees. The
best use-case would be to use hybrid chat-bot approach, which allows unsupervised
learning by observing dialog between employee and a client at first. Secondly, employee
would just be an additional layer between middleware and chat-bot, which results
in a supervised learning, where employee is the teacher. Mentioned strategy allows
developing highly efficient chat-bot without need to test in production on existing
users.

engagement and a farseeing growth basis. Existing forms of development are extremelly flexible
and can suit any forms of budget and time available. Banks can choose a level of influence and
control over product based on their needs. Nonetheless, entire system and approach
is a very risky form of investment and should be extremelly precisely analyzed by
management.

 id="x1-60006"></a>CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<a 
 id="Q1-1-34"></a>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >The main trend in commercial banking for the last decade is openness and availability. Even
though, from a regulatory perspective, forcing banks to allow third-party services to operate
with a bank in a digital way is a form to divide natural monopolies, openness and availability is
highly important on banking market by themselves. The market of information systems,
services and technologies is in all-time high and, obviously, affects such a giant as a banking
market. Banks by its structure are stable and fundamental, which is a logical barrier against
extensive development and changes. Nevertheless, an exponential growth of digital fields is a
catalyst for evolution of a banking market.
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >     Nowadays, commercial banks do both front-office and back-office work. Famous banking
stability and guarantees are good for back-office, but can be a massive hurdle in a front-office.
Front-office, as a form of client interaction, has to change as fast as possible in order to achieve
its client, client’s needs and purposes. Especially, when entire human ecosystem creates new
forms of people communication and interaction. Extrapolating last two decades we can expect
future development of both banking openness and world digitalization. Accordingly, banks have
to adapt to those changes.
</p><!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >     Currently, two trends, two forms of bank evolution are formulating — Bank-as-a-Service
and Bank-as-a-Platform. Bank-as-a-Service in a final form makes from a bank a back-office only
construct, whose customers are various financial services, which can be risky, can experiment
and are not too big to fall. Although, this form reminds of factoring, it is not. In
spite, those third-party financial services can create their own front-offices, and can
operate in fields, which are not available to common bank, in a such way that clients
even don’t know in which banks their accounts and loans are. Bank-as-a-Platform,
oppositely, is a center, which unites other third-party financial services under its hood and
brandname.
</p><!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >     Therefore, due to technology development, digitalizaton banks need new forms of
interaction. Moreover, younger generation is known to be more textual, messenger-friendly, and
often voice interaction impacts negatively. Among possibilities, one of the most efficient is a
chat-bot. From customer perspective chat-bot allows solving problems without spending time
on waiting for a customer service and without repeating same question towards multiple
                                                                                       
                                                                                       
consultants. From the banking side, more simple chat-bots decrease costs on customer service
and open the possibility to transfer hired employees into less digital fields that require
specialization. Furthermore, the same instrument may significantly increase client engagement
and offer growth mechanisms. On the other hand, in order to achieve client engagement and
use mentioned growth mechanisms, bank has to take a massive amount of risk and
costs.
</p><!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >     Regardless, banking sector should use openness trend and entire digital evolution in order
to be in the market. Moving towards Open Banking helps banking to share work
and risks in client interaction. Consequently, mentioned Machine Learning based
chat-bots can be done entirely by third-party providers and supported by them, if there
are proper instruments done by bank that allows those to use. On the other side,
third-party providers may not be able to do it entirely, but can offer certain blocks
of logic. In this case, a bank has to build a chat-bot and invest, but with the help
of third-party partners. For a bank mentioned system would be a beautiful piece
of a technology, a state-of-art, even though it will require lots of investments and
time.
</p><!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >     In my opinion, division of labour in banking sector is inevitable. Unfortunately, it is
impossible to know which way would banks develop, towards Banks-as-a-Platform or towards
Banks-as-a-Service.
</p><!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >     In both options banks have to make actions towards smart textual forms of client
communication. The point is to develop solution iteratively. Firstly, in all cases banks
have to move to even Opener Banking and create even more extensive API. After
that, banks can choose which way do they want to go, either to use already existing
solution and integrate with their systems, or to create something entirely new with the
latest technologies available. Integrating existing, more simple rule-based solutions
without Artificial Intelligence is an efficient form of interaction due to the fact that
entire chat-bot industry is still emerging. On the other side, creating own Chat-bot
with Artifical Intelligence, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing is an
insecure choice, possible for large banks, but definitely extremelly dangerous for small-
and medium-sized banks. Therefore, building chat-bots via third-party development
companies as solutions on premise would be the most balanced way of development of this
interaction.
