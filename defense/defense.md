## Chapter I
Chapter I is devoted to an overview of current banking system and influence of digital banking over it.
Additionally, mentioned chapter I contains analysis of various movements of banking towards openness, Open Banking and PSD2.

## Chapter II
In chapter II is an overview of current application of Artificial Intelligence and Conversational Banking paradigm.

## Chapter III

Chapter III concentrates over novel practical application of an AI in a Front-office in a form of a chatbot.
In addition, chapter III proposes a strategy for a chatbot solution development and integration in existing bank system.

Finally, results of econometric study are presented. 
Study shows respondents' satisfaction with existing front-office and their preparation towards chatbot as an interlocutor.

## Strategy of a chatbot solution
Proposal consists of 3 stages
- Open Banking API development
- Rule-based middleware
- Middleware with Machine Learning

Additionally, I have shown expected costs of those solitions in order to choose proper budgeting for specific expectations.

## Survey
Clients are not ready for chatbots yet.
Moreover, it is possible to conclude that chatbots are not that much for consumers, as they are an important evolution milestone for the banks.

Even if there would be a chatbot solution which passes some limited version of Turing test, when the customer finds
out that all that he was talking to a chatbot, he may feel deceived and lost trust to a bank.

The main hypothesis of this thesis was that Commercial Banking clients are ready for Automated Front Offices in a form of a chatbot.
Conclusively, this hypothesis has to be rejected.
People are not ready and have negative subjective feelings towards chatbots.
Changing those feelings would require significant marketing costs.

However, the most valid injection of a chatbot solution would be in a hybrid approach.
Hybrid approach is a synergy between human employee and an automated chatbot system.
In hybrid approach robot recommends an answer to an operator based on existing knowledge base.
In this case, customer trusts and employee, but receives exact fast answer from an internal chatbot system.

## Conclusions
The main trend in commercial banking for the last decade is openness and availability.
Even though, from a regulatory perspective, forcing banks to allow third-party services to operate with a bank in a digital way is a form to divide natural monopolies, openness and availability is highly important on banking market by themselves.
The market of information systems, services and technologies is in all-time high and, obviously, affects such a giant as a banking market.

Nowadays, commercial banks do both front-office and back-office work.
Famous banking stability and guarantees are good for back-office, but can be a massive hurdle in a front-office.
Front-office, as a form of client interaction, has to change as fast as possible in order to achieve its client, client's needs and purposes.
Especially, when entire human ecosystem creates new forms of people communication and interaction.
Extrapolating last two decades we can expect future development of both banking openness and world digitalization.
Accordingly, banks have to adapt to those changes.

Currently, two trends, two forms of bank evolution are formulating — Bank-as-a-Service and Bank-as-a-Platform.
Bank-as-a-Service in a final form makes from a bank a back-office only construct, whose customers are various financial services, which can be risky, can experiment and are not too big to fall.
Although, this form reminds of factoring, it is not.
In spite, those third-party financial services can create their own front-offices, and can operate in fields, which are not available to common bank, in a such way that clients even don't know in which banks their accounts and loans are.
Bank-as-a-Platform, oppositely, is a center, which unites other third-party financial services under its hood and brand name.

The main subject of this study was to research current state of industry, regulations and technology in order to examine requirements for a chatbot solution with Artificial Intelligence in a Commercial Banking Front Office and usefulness of such solution in a current market state.

The main hypothesis was: Commercial Banking clients are ready for Automated Front Offices in a form a chatbot. 
To proof this research survey was conducted. 
The result proves that the hypothesis has to be rejected.
People are not ready and have negative subjective feelings towards chatbots.
Changing those feelings would require significant marketing costs.

However, the most valid injection of a chatbot solution would be in a hybrid approach.
Hybrid approach is a synergy between human employee and an automated chatbot system.
In hybrid approach robot recommends an answer to an operator based on existing knowledge base.
In this case, customer trusts and employee, but receives exact fast answer from an internal chatbot system.

Therefore, due to technology development, digitalization banks need new forms of interaction.
Moreover, younger generation is known to be more textual, messenger-friendly, and often voice interaction impacts negatively.
Among possibilities, one of the most efficient is a chatbot.
From customer perspective chatbot allows solving problems without spending time on waiting for a customer service and without repeating same question towards multiple consultants.
From the banking side, the simplest chatbots decrease costs on customer service and open the possibility to transfer hired employees into less digital fields that require specialization.
Furthermore, the same instrument may significantly increase client engagement and offer growth mechanisms.
On the other hand, in order to achieve client engagement and use mentioned growth mechanisms, bank has to take a massive amount of risk and costs.

Regardless, banking sector should use openness trend and entire digital evolution in order to be in the market.
Moving towards Open Banking helps banking to share work and risks in client interaction.
Consequently, mentioned Machine Learning based chatbots can be done entirely by third-party providers and supported by them, if there are proper instruments done by bank that allows those to use.
On the other side, third-party providers may not be able to do it entirely, but can offer certain blocks of logic.
In this case, a bank has to build a chatbot and invest, but with the help of third-party partners.
For a bank mentioned system would be a beautiful piece of a technology, a state-of-art, even though it will require lots of investments and time.

In my opinion, division of labor in banking sector is inevitable.
Unfortunately, it is impossible to know which way would banks develop, towards Banks-as-a-Platform or towards Banks-as-a-Service.

In both options banks have to make actions towards smart textual forms of client communication.
The point is to develop solution iteratively.
Firstly, in all cases banks have to move to even Opener Banking and create even more extensive API.
After that, banks can choose which way do they want to go, either to use already existing solution and integrate with their systems, or to create something entirely new with the latest technologies available.
Integrating existing, the simplest rule-based solutions without Artificial Intelligence is an efficient form of interaction due to the fact that entire chatbot industry is still emerging.
On the other side, creating own chatbot with Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing is an insecure choice, possible for large banks, but definitely extremely dangerous for small- and medium-sized banks.
Therefore, building chatbots via third-party development companies as solutions on premise would be the most balanced way of development of this interaction.














# Preparation

To be well-prepared, make sure to review all your knowledge in economy specially in banking and finance.   

## Questions

### 1. Basic conclusions in Thesis, it's meaning in real life


### 2. Issues related to the fields of study (so basically about Economy: Micro and Macro and in all other you have final exam with.


### 3. Issues related to you Thesis directly


## Difference between monetary and fiscal policy
Tinbergen rule: if there exist conflicting goals of economic policy, you need as many (independent) policy tools as you have goals. Monetary policy is more efficient in achieving the inflation goal, while fiscal policy in achieving the output goal.

Monetary policy involves the management of the money supply and interest rates by central banks. 
It is more of a blunt tool in terms of expanding and contracting the money supply to influence inflation and growth, and has less impact on the real economy. 
Three different policy tools to influence the economy: open market operations, changing reserve requirements for banks and setting the discount rate. 
Open market operations are carried out on a daily basis when the CB buys and sells government bonds to either inject money into the economy or pull money out of circulation.
By setting the reserve ratio, or the percentage of deposits that banks are required to keep in reserve, directly influences the amount of money created when banks make loans. 
It also can target changes in the discount rate (the interest rate it charges on loans it makes to financial institutions), which is intended to impact short-term interest rates across the entire economy.

Generally speaking, the aim of most government fiscal policies is to target the total level of spending, the total composition of spending, or both in an economy. The two most widely used means of affecting fiscal policy are changes in government spending policies or in government tax policies.
If a government believes there is not enough business activity in an economy, it can increase the amount of money it spends, often referred to as stimulus spending. 
If there are not enough tax receipts to pay for the spending increases, governments borrow money by issuing debt securities such as government bonds and, in the process, accumulate debt. 
This is referred to as deficit spending.
In comparing the two, fiscal policy generally has a greater impact on consumers than monetary policy, as it can lead to increased employment and income.

## Financial system
There are Public finance, state budget and Government expenditures, and private, banks, Stock Exchange, Insurance.
Public: The efficient allocation of available resources, The distribution of income among citizens and The stability of the economy.
Financial services are the economic services provided by the finance industry, which encompasses a broad range of businesses that manage money, including credit unions, banks, credit-card companies, insurance companies, accountancy companies, consumer-finance companies, stock brokerages, investment funds, individual managers, and some government-sponsored enterprises.

## Banks

### The role of the Central Bank
Issuing bank. NBP has the sole right to issue the currency that is legal tender in Poland. Narodowy Bank Polski determines the amount of currency issued and the time at which the currency enters in circulation, for the liquidity of which it is responsible. It also organises money circulation and regulates the amount of currency in circulation.

Banks' bank. NBP performs regulatory functions with regard to other banks, in order to ensure the safety of deposits held by the banks and the stability of the banking sector. NBP organises the monetary clearing system, services current interbank settlements and actively participates in the interbank money market. Narodowy Bank Polski is responsible for the stability and safety of the entire banking system. NBP also supervises payment systems in Poland.

Central bank of the State. NBP provides banking services to the central government, holds the accounts of government and other central state institutions, state special-purpose funds, as well as central government entities, and executes their payment orders.

### Central Bank targets and tools used to achieve it
The primary goal of most central banks is to maintain price stability:
- Price stability is desirable because inflation creates uncertainty in the economy and that uncertainty might hamper economic growth.
- Long periods of excessive inflation or deflation have negative effects on the economy
- Rational expectations and time-inconsistency problem: https://www.nber.org/papers/w1079
- Tinbergen rule: if there exist conflicting goals of economic policy, you need as many (independent) policy tools as you have goals
- Monetary policy is more efficient in achieving the inflation goal, while fiscal policy in achieving the output goal
- Inflation is monetary phenomenon in the long-run and monetary policy is assumed to be neutral in the long-run (does not affect real activity).

Central banks may also have goals other than price stability, e.g.: 
- Economic growth
- High employment
- Financial stability
- External balance
- Exchange rate stability

The central bank’s goals may be different in different countries 
- Hierarchical mandate – price stability is primary goal and other policy goals may be pursued so long as they don’t conflict price stability
- Dual mandate – the central bank may pursue simultaneously price stability and other goals, even potentially conflicting with price stability.

The central bank cannot directly control such variables as inflation or economic growth (final goals):
- The central bank has a set of tools – open market operations, changes in the discount rate, and changes in reserve requirements. They are directly controlled but they affect the goals indirectly after a period of time.
- The central banks use intermediate targets – variables that have direct impact on the price level and employment, such as the monetary aggregates (M1, M2 or M3) or interest rates (short- or long-term).
- However, even the intermediate targets are not directly affected by the central bank’s policy tools.
- Therefore, central banks use another set of variables to aim for – policy instruments or alternatively operating instruments, such as reserve aggregates (reserves, nonborrowed reserves, monetary base, or non-borrowed base) or interest rates. They are more responsive to policy tools and indicate the stance (easy or tight) of monetary policy.

Tools of the Central Bank:
- Open market operations
- Discount policy
- Reserve requirements
- Interest on reserves
- Large-scale asset purchases
- Forward guidance

Policy Instruments:
- Reserve aggregates (reserves, nonborrowed reserves, monetary base, nonborrowed base)
- Short-term interest rate

Intermediate Targets:
- Monetary aggregates (M1, M2)
- Interest rates (short- and long-term)
- Inflation expectations

Goals:
- Price stability
- High employment
- Financial market stability
- Interest rate stability
- Foreign exchange market stability

### Commercial and Investment banks
Commercial banks accept deposits, make loans, safeguard assets, and work with many different types of clients, including the general public and businesses, transformation deposit into credit or in other words saving to investment., and investment bank (differences)
Investment banks, on the other hand, provide services to large corporations and institutional investors.
Clearly, the primary difference between investment banking and commercial banking is the clientele. Investment banks serve large, publicly traded corporations, while commercial banks cater to smaller, middle-market clients.
Also, there are major differences in services. Investment banks handle large amounts of money and advise their clients about sound investments. Commercial banks handle day-to-day financial transactions and smaller credit requests for mostly non-public borrowers.
Another key difference is that investment banks and their performance are tied to the stock market’s performance. On the other hand, commercial banks are affected by credit demand and economic growth.

## Type of Derivatives Instruments
- Forwards
- Futures
- Options
- Swaps

## Utility function
Utility function measures consumers' preferences for a set of goods and services.
- Law of diminishing marginal utility


## Game theory
This is

## Growth model like SOLOW production function
[//]: #### The Solow per capita production function


## Phillips curve
Concept that there is a negative correlation between unemployment and inflation in an economy.
However, stagflation exists, which is a slow economic growth and relatively high unemployment which is at the same time accompanied by inflation.


## Principal–agent relationship
A principal-agent relationship describes the relationship between a business or individual and someone hired by that business or person to act on their behalf. The principal is the business entity (or hiring individual), while the agent is the entity hired to act on behalf of the principal.


## GDP and how will it be counted
The gross domestic product (GDP) of a nation is an estimate of the total value of all the goods and services it produced during a specific period, usually a quarter or a year. Its greatest use is as a point of comparison: Did the nation's economy grow or contract compared to the previous period measured?
GDP can be calculated by adding up all of the money spent by consumers, businesses, and government in a given period.
It may also be calculated by adding up all of the money received by all the participants in the economy.
In either case, the number is an estimate of "nominal GDP."
Once adjusted to remove any effects due to inflation, "real GDP" is revealed.
GDP = Consumption + Investments + Govermental spending + (Exports - Imports)
or
GDP = Income + Depreciation of tangible assets + Taxes + NFFI
NFFI - net foreign factor income = total income of citizens outside minus total income of foreigners inside
GNP = GDP - foreign income in-state + citizen income out-of-state

## Different Investment strategies on Stock Exchange
Bulls and Bears.
Modern Portfolio theory requires diversification.
ETFs are close to market indices.

## Dividend, is it important for investors and why
It depends.
Zero yield environment requires investment into other processes.
On the other side, 

## Black-Scholes
The Black–Scholes or Black–Scholes–Merton model is a mathematical model for the dynamics of a financial market containing derivative investment instruments. 
From the partial differential equation in the model, known as the Black–Scholes equation, one can deduce the Black–Scholes formula, which gives a theoretical estimate of the price of European-style options and shows that the option has a unique price given the risk of the security and its expected return (instead replacing the security's expected return with the risk-neutral rate). 

Assumptions:
- Riskless rate - the rate of return on the riskless asset is constant and thus called the risk-free interest rate.
- Random walk - The instantaneous log return of stock price is an infinitesimal random walk with drift; more precisely, the stock price follows a geometric Brownian motion, and we will assume its drift and volatility are constant (if they are time-varying, we can deduce a suitably modified Black–Scholes formula quite simply, as long as the volatility is not random).
- The stock does not pay a dividend

Market assumptions:
- No arbitrage opportunity (i.e., there is no way to make a riskless profit).
- Ability to borrow and lend any amount, even fractional, of cash at the riskless rate.
- Ability to buy and sell any amount, even fractional, of the stock (This includes short selling).
- The above transactions do not incur any fees or costs (i.e., frictionless market).


## Bank 4.0 notes:
- Chinese financial system is developing, thanks to AliPay and WeChat.
- KYC and AML cost too much, $50-100 bln for 0.2% success rate.
- Migration of technologies towards Cloud Computing
- AR & VR
- Not products, but experiences

### RegTech and SupTech
Regulators must move to data-intensive, AI-driven monitoring of transactions, business conduct, and market patterns, using “RegTech” for regulators, or supervision technology, often called “SuperTech” or “SupTech”. This will require setting quantified, measurable standards for satisfying the principles embodied in the goals of each regulation, ranging from adequacy of risk-adjusted capital and preventing insider trading to non-discriminatory treatment of consumers.
