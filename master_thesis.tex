\begin{abstract}
    In 2007 PSD had shown an interest of financial regulators in banking competitiveness by digital instruments.
    Later, PSD2 triggered a new wave of banking digitalization, openness, big data usage and third-party integrations.
    This thesis seeks to analyze the ways of development of commercial banks Front Offices using ML \& AI technologies.
    The research focuses on the importance of openness brought by PSD2 and Open Banking initiative.
    Study investigates ways of application of ML \& AI technologies on various layers of a bank and 
    targets the importance of usage of available customer data in order to achieve market efficiency.
    The thesis proposes possible Chat-Bot solutions as a front-office, as a middle-office kit for front-end employees,
    as a product, which uses Banking-as-a-Platform and as a customer service solution for existing Banking-as-a-Service.
